Hi, I'm Yuan, a machine learning engineer at DoorDash working on search ranking and query understanding. In my former life as a computational cognitive scientist, I studied common sense causal and social reasoning, for which I received a PhD from Berkeley in 2022.

My passions in life: Machine learning (ranking, generative models), cognitively inspired AI, climbing, metal guitar, hot pot, and cats 🐱.
