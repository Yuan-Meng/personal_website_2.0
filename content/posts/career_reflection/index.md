# Foreword: To the Ambitious (and Confused) Early Career Engineers

I had far too chill parents growing up. The first day they dropped me off at school, I had no idea why I was there. I sat quietly, confused, for about a year before realizing there was such a thing as education. Similarly, when I started my first job at DoorDash in Summer 2022 (or shall I say "Q3"), I had far too chill a manager during my first 6 months and only gradually figured out what a career in engineering is about.

<!--more-->

Later, I read [Merih Taze](https://www.engineerssurvivalguide.com/)'s and [Gergely Orosz](https://www.engguidebook.com/)'s witty and pragmatic {{< sidenote "career books" >}}I was once averse to "career books", thinking they were written by cynical engineers monetizing common sense. I was unexpectedly touched by how sincere and even emotional Merih Taze was when recounting his career beginning, and by how much he knows about climbing the career ladder and playing office politics, yet still promotes curiosity and passion rather than being fixated on levels and promotions. My favorite Staff+ engineers are like that, and that's who I aspire to be one day.{{< /sidenote >}}. I've also built a career I'm proud of. Last week, I began my second job at Pinterest, one of my dream companies as an ML engineer. Now feels like a good time to share lessons from the books and re-imagine how I'd start my career all over again to advocate for myself more explicitly and aim for longer-term growth. I share this post with ambitious yet perhaps confused early career engineers.

# Play the Long Game

## Choose A Company

Everyone dreams of working for a company that offers competitive compensation, rapid career growth, excellent work-life balance, high job security, and hopefully visa sponsorship. A company meeting all 6 criteria may exist, but only during 2021-2022 tech boom or in your dreams. If there is such a place right now, nobody wants to leave, so no headcount can be created üòÖ. Something's gotta give.

{{< figure src="https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/nbcj1mzc1zkjbi1d36nsr/Screenshot-2024-12-21-at-11.44.01-PM.png?rlkey=ye7lujw71w0ql5zts1ywavf1x&st=u98le99e&raw=1" caption="Hexagon of impossibility: No companies hiring right now can satisfy all requirements of a dream job..." width="600">}}

As an immigrant living in an HCOL area, I think of good compensation, visa sponsorship, and job security as must-haves for me. Companies that satisfy these constraints have to trade off among great WLB, rapid growth, and transferable (as opposed to niche/internal) skills:

1. **High-growth established companies**: At famously fast-paced companies like Meta and DoorDash, promotions at lower levels (E3 $\rightarrow$ E4 $\rightarrow$ E5) come quickly if you work hard on a core team with strong business needs, and compensation can be exceptional if you join when the stock price is low. However, WLB may take a toll, as stakeholders and leadership will monitor your work very closely, and you'll likely work on launch after launch non-stop.
2. **High-growth startups**: At top AI startups like OpenAI or Anthropic, base salaries are even higher (e.g., ~$300K for E5, which beats E7 base salaries at most tech companies), but the stock compensation is paper money and WLB is more challenging since the work is more cutting-edge, the teams are smaller, priorities shift faster, and your job depends on the launches.
3. **Stable established companies**: Companies such as LinkedIn, Google, Airbnb, and Pinterest were once known for good WLB but slower promotion to the senior (E5) level --- particularly the first two. In this market, however, work culture has become more intense almost everywhere, especially on cash cow üêÆ teams.

When choosing my first job, I had just moved to the other side of the Bay and didn't have many friends around. My priority was to cram as much engineering knowledge as possible and take on as much work as I could to make up for a lack of direct impact I felt during my PhD. DoorDash was the perfect choice for that phase, and probably so was Meta. Over time, I wanted to become an expert of one domain, even at the expense of some {{< sidenote "scope" >}}DoorDash Ads has 10 MLE's working on ranking, whereas at Pinterest, several dozens of MLEs across multiple teams work on different stages of ranking. Naturally, MLEs at the same level own a much larger scope at the former.{{< /sidenote >}} and impact. Some friends thought I was crazy, whereas others supported my belief that career growth is not a sprint but a marathon, for which deep domain expertise goes a long way --- if you want to tech lead a cutting-edge ML team  someday. 

So, I interviewed with several type-2 and type-3 companies. Ultimately, I decided to join a type-3 company because, outside of work, I wanted to explore more of nature, invest more in personal relationships, be more active in sports, and enjoy more great food, sights, and conversations. I'm fine with being reasonably busy (~50 hours per week, maybe 60 before launches), but a 70-hour week at OpenAI or Anthropic might just be too much. In today's employer's market, you may not have many choices (you'll have some if you ace interviews; see {{< backlink "mle_interviews" "my post">}} for MLE interview tips). If you can decide what to do, be honest about what makes *your life* more fulfilling as a whole --- being a great ML engineer may just be a small part of it.

## Whole Career Optimization

> You career will likely be measured in decades, not by performance review cycles. --- *The Software Engineer's Guidebook*, ch. 3, p. 45

I had a straightforward educational path: K-12 $\rightarrow$ undergrad $\rightarrow$ PhD. I used to think a "normal" engineering career would be just as linear: Junior (E3/E4) $\rightarrow$ Senior (E5) $\rightarrow$ Staff (E6) $\rightarrow$ Senior Staff (E7) $\rightarrow$ Principal (E8) $\rightarrow$ Distinguished (E9) $\rightarrow$ [FIRE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIRE_movement). Then I realized getting to the Senior level fast means little since everyone gets there sooner or later, as it's the terminal level at most tech companies. By contrast, not everyone can or wants to go beyond that. Getting to Staff+ levels requires luck, budgets, and, more importantly, the very curiosity and passion that drove you to become an engineer in the first place.

Engineer A might progress through E3/E4 $\rightarrow$ E5 $\rightarrow$ E6 promotions quickly at their current company but struggle to find Staff+ roles elsewhere if all they know is how to make things work in one particular environment. Meanwhile, Engineer B makes a lateral move or gets down-leveled to join a larger, more technically sophisticated company, but may find it easier to land Staff+ positions later on thanks to the technical depth/breadth/complexity they've learned to navigate. Over and again in Merih Taze's and Gergely Orosz's books and from my favorite Staff+ engineers, this message rings true: If you plan to build an engineering career over decades, play the long game. Chase your curiosity and passion, and one day you shall become a force of nature in your field. If this is not a life goal of yours, great --- you have even less of a reason to stress about levels and promotions.

## Find A Mentor
- **Mentor `==` personalized career book**: Every realization you reach with blood, sweat, and tears may be learned more painlessly from a trusted mentor who has years of experience and can tailor their answers to your specific problem. My biggest regret at DoorDash was not seeking out a mentor earlier --- a Staff engineer liked my blog and reached out to me in my last 6 months, but the advice came but too late. Find a mentor early!
- **What's in it for them?**: My biggest fear is wasting someone's time without giving anything in return. I have a lot to gain from a mentor, but what's in it for them? I asked several seasoned engineers this, and their answer was almost always that they enjoy seeing bright, motivated junior engineers grow --- like watching their younger selves. So the best you can do is show up to 1:1's with thoughtful questions, demonstrate consistent progress, and pay it forward to future junior engineers.
- **Mentors provide perspectives**: Junior engineers may not lack technical depth --- they could be fresh PhDs who've published in the domain you're working on and interned at several big tech companies. What they usually lack is perspective: Is project X a gold mine or a landmine? Is person Y being mean or normal?... Having a mentor shed light on what you're going through helps you find the silver lining in what you otherwise see as a dead end.

# Walk the Walk

To get hired or promoted, you don't have to be a good engineer --- plenty of confident, charismatic engineers who don't honestly know their craft survive and thrive. That said, as soon as their support {{< sidenote "disappears" >}}Or if someone joins the team with years of hands-on experience in this domain and the authority to speak up.{{< /sidenote >}}, it would be hard for them to stay in their current job, and interviewing into a place full of domain experts won't be easy. 

Think of your career as an ad --- without the proper branding and communication, rarely will someone seek you out; but without the substance to support your fa√ßade, the "false advertising" will one day lead to a refund, or at times, even a lawsuit.

So, I suppose the most universal path toward building a fruitful engineering career is to actually be a good engineer: One with solid skills who commits to continuous learning, solves problems efficiently and creatively, manages time wisely, adapts to changing priorities willingly, and makes principled trade-offs when the time comes.

## Solve the Right Problem

The more senior you become, the more important it is to make sure that you're not just solving the problem at hand right, but solving the right problem that aligns with your company/org/team priorities.

- **Understand company priorities**: How do you know what your company/org/team prioritizes? Attend company and org all-hands, ask management what's {{< sidenote "on their mind" >}}If you ask directly whether leadership values a specific area, the answer will most certainly be "yes" ‚Äî it would be demoralizing to label something many engineers work on as unimportant. As Gergely Orosz suggested, pay attention to what they are not enthusiastically talking about and infer backward what may not be the current focus.{{< /sidenote >}} during 1:1's and office hours, listen to earnings calls, attend design reviews on sister teams, and try putting yourself in the shoes of a user to imagine what initiatives would improve their experience the most.
- **Don't work on projects you know are unimportant**: When you're new to a team or very junior, it can be difficult to turn down projects assigned to you. In time, I've come to realize that my responsibility is not to deliver a particular project but to deliver the key results (KRs) of my company/org/team. If I believe a project doesn't align with company/org/team priorities, it's my responsibility to show why that is with data and switch to a higher-priority, higher-impact project or propose one. Prioritization is not only critical for your career development (think about performance reviews and promotions), but also for the success of your team and the users of your product.

## Solve the Problem Right 
But of course, your career won't go anywhere if you've spotted and undertaken a right problem but don't get things done. Solving the problem right is *the* core skill across all engineering levels. 

- **Gather requirements**: If you don't know what to build, you can't build it well. For instance, will your new Search models/features apply to retrieval to optimize for Recall, or to re-ranking to boost Precision? The objective determines what data you should use, how to define positives/negatives, and so on. Clarify these requirements with your product manager and engineering partners, and chase after people for more context if need be. Don't assume everyone is on the same page --- after figuring out the crux of the problem, bring everyone to a consensus on the nature and the scope of the product/engineering problem and what ‚Äúdelivered‚Äù really means (e.g., milestones to hit, success metrics to move, and guardrail metrics to watch out for).
- **Evolve with ambiguity**: Sometimes, the starting point is even more ambiguous, especially when you become more senior. For instance, you may be given an abstract goal --- improve search relevance. But how? And how is relevance even defined? In such cases, start an empty design doc with a ‚ÄúRequirements‚Äù section and involve tech leads and stakeholders from relevant (no puns intended ü§£) teams to collect requirements (e.g., what relevance definitions best serve the product goals and user experience, how much Recall or engagement we can sacrifice for relevance, whether to build a separate relevance model or add a relevance head to a multi‚Äëtask model, etc.) and constraints (e.g., which prediction services are available for this use case, the latency budget, where in the Search funnel to apply the model, etc.).
	
	Once requirements and constraints are gathered, leverage your domain expertise to design viable solutions and discuss options in small groups (e.g., tech leads, engineers with most contexts, and people who have a say in approving your design). Before the final design review, you should've already resolved conflicting requirements by labeling some as must-haves and others as nice-to-haves and ensuring your solution immediately satisfies the former and can accommodate the latter in the future. The final review is not a discussion --- you're there to convince people *with data* that the path you propose offers the best trade-off between quality vs. velocity, short-term vs. long-term goals, and so on. 
- **Embrace a leap of faith**: In my 2.5-year tenure at DoorDash, it's crazy how I've worked on multiple subdomains in Search (query understanding, L1/L2 ranking, AutoComplete) as well as domains outside of Search, such as content understanding and P13N. It's crazier that I've launched models in each domain. Every time I took on a new project, I had no way of predicting whether it would be a win or a flop. I used to panic after switching domains but over time, I've learned to embrace a "leap of faith". If I deeply understand the codebase and the user problem, align with stakeholders early, remind myself of ML 101, discuss "silly" ideas with trusted thought partners, and execute tightly and transparently, I can usually improve the system from the baseline in some way. If not, I dive deeper, iterate, or rethink and realign the team with what "success" means for actual users. The courage and ability to start anew make me who I am as an engineer and are essentially what behavioral interviews tap into.
- **Invest in continuous learning**: If all you rely on is a leap of faith, you'll leap into an abyss someday. As ML engineers, we should learn from other teams in the company that face similar problems, stay current to classic and SOTA ML research from academia and industry, and push beyond our comfort zones to understand the system as a whole (e.g., front-end event logging, backend services, platforms, etc.). Sometimes I learn these skills before starting a new project, but more often, I learn them along the way. How we solve a problem right 5 years ago may well differ from how we solve it right today --- so never stop learning.


## Manage Time Wisely
> The worst thing you can do is burn yourself out. Never forget you are your most valuable asset. If you burn yourself out, you will not enjoy what you are doing; you will not be motivated; you will not be learning much; you will get tired faster... --- *Engineer's Survival Guide*, ch. 59, p. 233

Most engineers are busy and many are kind, so it can be a struggle to turn down an ask to focus on higher-priority tasks. Early in my career, being turned down by colleagues I considered friends felt like a personal rejection. Merih Taze's book helped me realize that burning ourselves out is the worst outcome --- if it happens, we can't help anyone. Prioritization is an act of kindness for ourselves and our team.

- **Say no without saying "No"**: Every "Yes" you say to something is a "No" to something else, unless you decide to work 60 hours a week and risk burning out. The PM asks you to explain a model defect; business partners want you to override a model prediction with business logic; leadership wants you to build a model for a new initiative; your tech lead suggests that you refactor a piece of code... The asks are endless in the life of an engineer, so it's important to track your tasks (e.g., in JIRA or a Google Doc), assign priorities (P0/P1/P2), and keep a backlog of things to revisit. When you really must say no to a task now, don't use the word "No" --- instead, let people know that you're willing to help but can only do it after X, Y, and Z are done. Either they'll wait, or they'll find another available engineer to do it.
- **Automate tedious tasks**: Early in my career, I spent about one hour each week taking requests from business and product partners to override a query understanding model's output. This one hour might not seem like much on any given week, but it interrupted my focus time, didn't teach me new skills, and added up over time. In hindsight, I should have automated this task the second time I was asked. If a tedious task becomes a recurring pattern, automate it; if it's a common need, you can "sell" your tool to folks doing similar tasks. It will make a great engineering excellence project to showcase in performance reviews.
- **Set focus blocks**: People will respect it if you set focus blocks during your most productive hours. Use them for the most challenging work, such as writing code for a new model or outlining trade-offs for a new design. However, if your calendar is full of focus blocks, people may find you too unavailable or ignore these blocks and schedule meetings anyway. Use them sparingly.
- **Acknowledge and respond later**: In grad school, some professors would take 2 weeks to answer my email, and that was considered normal in academia. In the tech industry, people would think you've resigned üòÇ. Some colleagues told me they got feedback for not answering Slack quickly enough, but if all we do is respond to Slack pings/threads or doc comments, we'd never get anything done. One trick from Merih Taze is to always acknowledge a message that tags you (e.g., by clicking on the "ACK" emoji or typing "ACK! Currently in a meeting/interview/incident. Will take a look by XXX.""). That way, people know you're working (rather than slacking off; no puns) and know when to circle back.

## Adapt to Changes
> Why is being excited about a situation so important? Because it opens you up instead of closing you down. When fearful, we tend to be protective, pessimistic, ready to right or flee, or jump on the first solution we see. When we are excited, we start having fun with what we are doing. --- *Engineers' Survival Guide*, ch. 8, p. 58

- **See changes as challenges, not problems**: Reorgs, layoffs, attrition, stock drops, etc. --- these are engineers' worst nightmares. You can switch to a more optimistic perspective and see these challenges as opportunities --- reorgs let you learn new parts of the system and build new connections; layoffs either validate the importance of your projects or provide severance for you to find new opportunities with stronger business needs (otherwise, those external teams wouldn't be hiring); people quitting lets you drop lower-priority projects you didn't want to own and step up to higher-impact ones; and a lower stock price now means your refresher will be worth more in the future.
- **Be excited about the unknowns**: We talked about this in the ["Solve the Problem Right"](https://www.yuan-meng.com/posts/career_reflection/#solve-the-problem-right) section: Driving ambiguity means gradually eliminating unknowns through discussions and alignment. Good engineers not only have to navigate these unknowns but are excited about them, because it gives them the chance to build new skills and become more well-rounded.

## Take Initiatives & Risks
> The rush in your veins and that excitement of achieving something is what keeps us motivated [...] I realized I was too scared to fail, so I kept playing it safe [...] Death might sound scarier to you than failing a project, but for me, it was vice versa. --- *Engineers' Survival Guide*, ch. 30, p. 114

- **See an opportunity? Run with it**: During my brief stint on the Content Understanding team at DoorDash (or what they call "Catalog"), I worked with an amazing ML engineer who'd think of an idea in the morning, write a proposal in the afternoon, build a prototype the next day, and show a demo the following week. Many of these ideas turned into production models or processes that benefited other engineers. Of course, promotion came quickly, and people loved working with him. Later, I asked this engineer how he had so much energy to explore so many new areas; he said he was excited every time he thought of a good idea, and helping it see the light of the day made him happy. Inspiration is a priceless commodity in our profession yet fleeting --- if you want to do something, do it before the spark is gone!
- **Don't put all your eggs in one basket**: That said, if all you focus on are big bets, long-term visions, or experimental projects, should they all fail, you'd have nothing to show in your performance reviews and could even be shown the door. My new manager at Pinterest suggested that engineers work on both a primary and a secondary project to balance risks, deliverables, impact, and interest. Coincidentally, this was the approach I took at DoorDash --- at any given time, I was working on at least two projects (sometimes three). It was more demanding in terms of time and energy, but when one project felt stuck, I could gain confidence from making progress on another, then revisit the first once I had new ideas. I've seen teammates commit to a single long-term investment for months and become frustrated. Of course, you might wonder: What if both projects fail? Then it means you need to pick more risk-balanced projects from the start.
- **Pace yourself between stretching and executing**: When should you take on a second project? Ideally, when the first project is more or less on autopilot --- i.e., after you've familiarized yourself with the domain knowledge and cross-functional (XFN) partners, and it's simply a matter of executing the planned milestones. That's a good time to begin a new project that will "stretch" you to explore unknowns and learn new skills. Stretching between two big unknowns at once, however, can be a terrible idea.

## Delegate with Trust
> You cannot keep steering engineers left and right and right and left, hoping to stay perfectly aligned. You need to give them room and just set the direction, measure the speed, and know precisely when you will get to your destination. --- *The Software Engineer's Guidebook*, ch. 10, p. 29

- **Let people fail so they can learn**: I know an engineer who was so exceptionally kind that she treated junior mentees like her "kids" --- to prevent them from failing, she'd list every potential solution to try and rewrite every line of their design docs. Later, I went on a skiing trip with this engineer. When I was learning to put on snowboarding boots for the first time in the rental shop, she'd reach her hand out and do it for me whenever I missed a step.

	But was it really important for me to immediately get into the boots in the shop? No, because I wasn't actually snowboarding yet, and the point was to learn how to do it myself on the mountains. Similarly, was it critical for the junior mentee to deliver their warmup project in 5 weeks instead of 6? No, because they weren't yet committing to a team KR, and the point was to learn how to flesh out an idea from a vague direction while on the job.

	When I was leaving DoorDash, a new grad joined my team. I resisted the urge to provide full code examples for their new project and instead left building blocks and pointers. If someone had given me the solution when I was a new grad, I‚Äòd never have learned how to build an end-to-end model pipeline on my own.
- **Read people and their estimates**: When you become a Staff+ engineer, you may not write much code anymore, since your new role is now coming up with visions, setting directions, and coordinating with other teams. It's then up to E3/E4/E5 engineers to execute your vision. Some add extra padding to their estimates, while others don't; some deliver on time, while others need nudging. Reading people and translating their estimates into a rough timeline is an essential skill for a tech lead.


## Having Fun

- **Remember your roots**: It may be my sampling bias, but when I ask every MLE colleague and friend why they chose ML engineering as their profession, they always answer that they enjoy modeling and the beauty of AI/ML, at least at some point in their life. But if you sit in any restaurant in the South Bay, you'll overhear people talking about who interviewed where and what package they got, or who tried for a promotion but got denied for pissing off so-and-so. Immersed in this environment, a fixation on levels, promotions, and office politics may become all you see and care about. In the last 6 months, I've been reminding myself: If it weren't for love, would I get so excited reading an ML paper full of clever tricks? If I chose ML for love, then it's fun that I shall have. If I gain new skills, get clever at politics, and get promoted along the way, I'll be thrilled since I can have more fun at scale.
- **Surround yourself with fun folks**: To the above point --- if you surround yourself with people fixated on levels, promotions, and politics, you'll either become like them or you'll feel stressed out. If so, surround yourself with different people who make you feel relaxed, inspired, enlightened, and closer to your foots.
- **Network with "partners in crime"**: It could be my [Peter Pan syndrome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Pan_syndrome) talking, but in hindsight, I probably should've panicked more instead of treating work as all game and fun. There were times I took on a project without any active service owner or was asked to build a model with no usable data. If I couldn't deliver, I risked being put on a PIP. But instead of panicking, I joked with my colleagues (some of whom are good friends) about the "dire" situation, brainstormed ideas (whether they worked or not), and eventually found solutions after trial and error. It felt like solving a murder mystery: There's no guarantee you'll catch the culprit with limited clues, but it's fun when your reasoning pays off.

	When you're having fun at work, people tend to like you more and often lend a hand when they don't have to. Years later, I realized that's what "networking" really is --- it's not sending cold emails, but building relationships where people know you, trust you, and want to work with you. That is your network.

# Talk the Talk

Your achievements don't speak for themselves. If you've done something well, you gotta let people know (e.g., your manager, skip manager, higher-ups, tech lead, mentor, peer reviewers, etc.). If there's one thing to remember from the books and experience, it's that while good managers advocate and fight for you, you are the ultimate owner of your career. If you don't speak for yourself, someone else may speak for you if you're very lucky, but luck is rare and out of your control.

I recently had a bizarre conversation with a younger engineer who proudly told me their goal was to "do the right thing" rather than "get promoted". The false dichotomy was bizarre --- if you're doing the right thing in the right place and telling the right people, you will get promoted. If so, you'll have more power to do more right things. If not, then you should either change the place or find more allies.

## Being Visible

A former colleague and good friend of mine used to share 3 separate laughs with me whenever we heard the word "visibility". That's because we once worked with an engineer who'd push people to adopt his experimental features and models without evaluating them or even providing reproducible code or documentation. He'd advertise his work to anyone and everyone who would listen. That's not visibility --- there's a difference between being visible and being loud.

Being visible means doing good work and keeping people in the loop, whereas being loud is repeating an invalidated idea till it sounds OK.

- **Share updates**: To help stakeholders and internal team members keep track of your progress, share updates during workstream syncs, post meeting and action item summaries in Slack channels, and track progress/blockers/ETAs in widely shared docs for people to check asynchronously. Don't keep people in the dark.
- **Attend design reviews**: Attend design reviews on your team and sister teams, and leave insightful, {{< sidenote "actionable" >}}You should only leave a comment if you're genuinely curious or want to help. If your intention is to show off something you know (and think others don't), people will see right through you and find you pretentious.{{< /sidenote >}} comments in design docs. This also keeps you informed about what's happening in your organization and to find opportunities to collaborate with other teams --- perhaps scattered tech stacks can be streamlined, and perhaps modeling ideas and features can be shared.
- **Answer questions in public"**: This ties back to ["Manage Time Wisely"](https://www.yuan-meng.com/posts/career_reflection/#manage-time-wisely) --- if someone asks you something other engineers would benefit from knowing, ask them to post the question in a public channel and answer it there. This way, future engineers can search Slack for the answers (or you can share the link at least), and your teammates and manager can see your effort, which builds your reputation as helpful and the go-to domain expert.
- **Open-source internally**: Apart from my immediate collaborators, the engineers I remember and admire most are those who open-sourced handy tools to make life easier, wrote detailed wikis and docs explaining how things work in their team/org, and created libraries or packages to capture recurring design patterns for other engineers to reuse. Be one of them!
- **Do knowledge sharing**: If you've created an open-source tool like the ones above, schedule a session to show people how to use it. If you've learned a good practice or read relevant papers from academia or industry, share the knowledge with the team. While engineers are busy, I've found most make time for knowledge sharing --- learning something cool is often the highlight of our day, and we remember those who bring knowledge and joy.
- **Keep a "bragging doc"**: Instead of writing down your achievements once or twice a year for performance reviews, note them as soon as they happen in a ‚Äúbragging doc". It's not at all about bragging to your teammates, but rather helping your manager see your progress at a glance and preparing yourself for future performance reviews and promotion cases.

## Be An Owner
- **Find an ownership area**: The most straightforward path to grow and become an invaluable team member is to find an ownership area and become the go-to person in that area. This isn't always easy for new hires and junior engineers --- whenever there's a fire, you're most likely to be asked to fight it, since your lack of domain knowledge makes you the "least damaging" person to randomize. This can be a great opportunity to gain technical breadth early on, but promotions may come more slowly since you won't have as coherent a story as someone who's made consistent contributions in one area. A great suggestion from Merih Taze is to talk to the tech lead and experienced engineers when you join the team to learn which areas don't have clear owners yet (e.g., everyone might love to work on model architectures, but almost no one dives into model serving). That's your chance to own that area.
- **Be product-minded**: Good engineers execute what's assigned to them, while great engineers are power users of their own product who look for ways to improve the user experience. Talk to product managers, user researchers, and data scientists --- learn from their product sense and grow useful ideas from there.
- **Unblock yourself**: Always search (e.g., Google, Slack, GitHub, company wiki) before you ask a question. If your question hasn't been answered, summarize concisely what you've researched and ask about what you still need to know. If people don't respond to critical questions, give them a gentle nudge. If they remain unresponsive, ask your manager to apply more weight. In any case, don't just sit there while watching your project getting blocked --- do all you can to unblock yourself and move forward.
- **Seek feedback early and often**: It is against human nature to seek and share feedback --- everyone wants to maintain a friendly, happy appearance, and feedback can be uncomfortable. But it's too late to learn how people really think of you during performance reviews --- if there's more than a little "constructive feedback", your rating will suffer and you won't have time to fix it. Ask your collaborators and manager about specific things you did --- e.g., "How was my communication/time management when executing project X?" The more specific your questions, the more actionable the feedback and the less personal it will feel.
- **Learn the jargon**: Tech companies are obsessed with abbreviations, and so is the ML community --- keep a doc to track new jargon and its meaning. This helps you understand internal docs and research papers more easily and speak the same language as your colleagues to improve communication efficiency.
- **Learn popular frameworks**: As an ML engineer working on deep learning, there's no excuse not to be familiar with PyTorh for and popular frameworks in your domain (e.g., TorchRec, Transformers, LLM APIs, Ray, etc.). Every brilliant idea ultimately depends on your familiarity with essential tools to get things done.

## Reach A Consensus
> This is where the conflict starts with people. They are not against your idea; they just do not have enough data about it. The more data you can provide, the easier it will be for them to believe in it. --- *Engineers' Survival Guide*, ch. 3, p. 9

- **No one argues with data**: bring data to the gun fight; - lead people towards your idea using data that you relied yourself to come up with that idea
- **Prototype fast**: work on a prototype fast => don't talk in the abstract
- **Invite an odd number of tie-breakers**: for important meetings
- **Review in small groups first**: have small group review first 
- **Write questions**: prevent mtg from getting hijacked: write down questions / objections as TODO in design docs; put it on tasks

## Share Credit And Blame
ÊúâÁ¶èÂêå‰∫´ÊúâÈöæÂêåÂΩì
- **Give credit wherever it's due**: the more you give it, the more you will receive => tell to their face + tell to orhers (to use it; mgr)
- **Take responsibilities**: fuck up something? design a better process around it

## Resolve Conflicts
- **Don't be a "conflict" person**: XX
- **Find a way to collaborate**: hange communication style; - find a different way to contribute to projects
- **Take a break**: rather than react 
- **Document conflicts**: have a new perspective
