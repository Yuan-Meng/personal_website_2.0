# Foreword: To the Ambitious (and Confused) Early Career Engineers

I had far too chill parents growing up. The first day they dropped me off at school, I had no idea why I was there. I sat quietly, confused, for about a year before realizing there was such a thing as education. Similarly, when I started my first job at DoorDash in Summer 2022 (or shall I say "Q3"), I had far too chill a manager during my first 6 months and only gradually figured out what a career in engineering is about.

<!--more-->

Later, I read [Merih Taze](https://www.engineerssurvivalguide.com/)'s and [Gergely Orosz](https://www.engguidebook.com/)'s witty and pragmatic {{< sidenote "career books" >}}I was once averse to "career books", thinking they were written by cynical engineers monetizing common sense. I was unexpectedly touched by how sincere and even emotional Merih Taze was when recounting his career beginning, and by how much he knows about climbing the career ladder and playing office politics, yet still promotes curiosity and passion rather than being fixated on levels and promotions. My favorite Staff+ engineers are like that, and that's who I aspire to be one day.{{< /sidenote >}}. I've also built a career I'm proud of. Last week, I began my second job at Pinterest, one of my dream companies as an ML engineer. Now feels like a good time to share lessons from the books and re-imagine how I'd start my career all over again to advocate for myself more explicitly and aim for longer-term growth. I share this post with ambitious yet perhaps confused early career engineers.

# Choose A Company

## Hexagon of Impossibility

Everyone dreams of working for a company that offers competitive compensation, rapid career growth, excellent work-life balance, high job security, and hopefully visa sponsorship. A company meeting all 6 criteria may exist, but only during 2021-2022 tech boom or in your dreams. If there is such a place right now, nobody wants to leave, so no headcount can be created üòÖ. Something's gotta give.

{{< figure src="https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/nbcj1mzc1zkjbi1d36nsr/Screenshot-2024-12-21-at-11.44.01-PM.png?rlkey=ye7lujw71w0ql5zts1ywavf1x&st=u98le99e&raw=1" caption="No companies hiring right now can satisfy all requirements of a dream job..." width="600">}}

## Something's Gotta Give

As an immigrant living in an HCOL area, I think of good compensation, visa sponsorship, and job security as must-haves for me. Companies that satisfy these constraints have to trade off among great WLB, rapid growth, and transferable (as opposed to niche/internal) skills:

1. **High-growth established companies**: At famously fast-paced companies like Meta and DoorDash, promotions at lower levels (E3 $\rightarrow$ E4 $\rightarrow$ E5) come quickly if you work hard on a core team with strong business needs, and compensation can be exceptional if you join when the stock price is low. However, WLB may take a toll, as stakeholders and leadership will monitor your work very closely, and you'll likely work on launch after launch non-stop.
2. **High-growth startups**: At top AI startups like OpenAI or Anthropic, base salaries are even higher (e.g., ~$300K for E5, which beats E7 base salaries at most tech companies), but the stock compensation is paper money and WLB is more challenging since the work is more cutting-edge, the teams are smaller, priorities shift faster, and your job depends on the launches.
3. **Stable established companies**: Companies such as LinkedIn, Google, Airbnb, and Pinterest were once known for good WLB but slower promotion to the senior (E5) level --- particularly the first two. In this market, however, w culture has become more intense almost everywhere, especially on cash cow üêÆ teams.

When choosing my first job, I had just moved to the other side of the Bay and didn't have many friends around. My priority was to cram as much engineering knowledge as possible and take on as much work as I could to make up for a lack of direct impact I felt during my PhD. DoorDash was the perfect choice for that phase, and probably so was Meta. Over time, I wanted to become an expert of one domain, even at the expense of some {{< sidenote "scope" >}}DoorDash Ads has 10 MLE's working on ranking, whereas at Pinterest, several dozens of MLEs across multiple teams work on different stages of ranking. Naturally, MLEs at the same level own a much larger scope at the former.{{< /sidenote >}} and impact. Some friends thought I was crazy, whereas others supported my belief that career growth is not a sprint but a marathon, for which deep domain expertise goes a long way --- if you want to tech lead a cutting-edge ML team  someday. 

So, I interviewed with several type-2 and type-3 companies. Ultimately, I decided to join a type-3 company because, outside of work, I wanted to explore more of nature, invest more in personal relationships, be more active in sports, and enjoy more great food, sights, and conversations. I'm fine with being reasonably busy (~50 hours per week, maybe 60 before launches), but a 70-hour week at OpenAI or Anthropic might just be too much. In today's employer's market, you may not have many choices (you'll have some if you ace interviews; see {{< backlink "mle_interviews" "my post">}} for MLE interview tips). If you can decide what to do, be honest about what makes *your life* more fulfilling as a whole --- being a great ML engineer may just be a small part of it.

## Play the Long Game

> You career will likely be measured in decades, not by performance review cycles. --- *The Software Engineer's Guidebook*, ch. 3, p. 45

I had a straightforward educational path: K-12 $\rightarrow$ undergrad $\rightarrow$ PhD. I used to think a "normal" engineering career would be just as linear: Junior (E3/E4) $\rightarrow$ Senior (E5) $\rightarrow$ Staff (E6) $\rightarrow$ Senior Staff (E7) $\rightarrow$ Principal (E8) $\rightarrow$ Distinguished (E9) $\rightarrow$ [FIRE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIRE_movement). Then I realized getting to the Senior level fast means little since everyone gets because sooner or later, as it's the terminal level at most tech companies. By contrast, not everyone can or wants to go beyond that. Getting to Staff+ levels requires luck, budgets, and, more importantly, the very curiosity and passion that drove you to become an engineer in the first place.

Engineer A might progress through E3/E4 $\rightarrow$ E5 $\rightarrow$ E6 promotions quickly at their current company but struggle to find Staff+ roles elsewhere if all they know is how to make things work in one particular environment. Meanwhile, Engineer B makes a lateral move or gets down-leveled to join a larger, more technically sophisticated company, but may find it easier to land Staff+ positions later on thanks to the technical depth/breadth/complexity they've learned to navigate. Over and again in Merih Taze's and Gergely Orosz's books and from my favorite Staff+ engineers, this message rings true: If you plan to build an engineering career over decades, play the long game. Chase your curiosity and passion, and one day you shall become a force of nature in your field. If this is not a life goal of yours, great --- you have even less of a reason to stress about levels and promotions.

# Walk the Walk

To get hired or promoted, you don't have to be a good engineer --- plenty of confident, charismatic engineers who don't honestly know their craft survive and thrive. That said, as soon as their support {{< sidenote "disappears" >}}Or if someone joins the team with years of hands-on experience in this domain and the authority to speak up.{{< /sidenote >}}, it would be hard for them to stay in their current job, and interviewing into a place full of domain experts won't be easy. 

Think of your career as an ad --- without the proper branding and communication, rarely will someone seek you out; but without the substance to support your fa√ßade, the "false advertising" will one day lead to a refund, or at times, even a lawsuit.

So, I suppose the most universal path toward building a fruitful engineering career is to actually be a good engineer: One with solid skills who commits to continuous learning, solves problems efficiently and creatively, manages time wisely, adapts to changing priorities willingly, and makes principled trade-offs when the time comes.

## Solve the Right Problem

The more senior you become, the more important it is to make sure that you're not just solving the problem at hand right, but solving the right problem that aligns with your company/org/team priorities.

- **Understand company priorities**: How do you know what your company/org/team prioritizes? Attend company and org all-hands, ask management what's {{< sidenote "on their mind" >}}If you ask directly whether leadership values a specific area, the answer will most certainly be "yes" ‚Äî it would be demoralizing to label something many engineers work on as unimportant. As Gergely Orosz suggested, pay attention to what they are not enthusiastically talking about and infer backward what may not be the current focus.{{< /sidenote >}} during 1:1's and office hours, listen to earnings calls, attend design reviews on sister teams, and try putting yourself in the shoes of a user to imagine what initiatives would improve their experience the most.
- **Don't work on projects you know are unimportant**: When you're new to a team or very junior, it can be difficult to turn down projects assigned to you. In time, I've come to realize that my responsibility is not to deliver a particular project but to deliver the key results (KRs) of my company/org/team. If I believe a project doesn't align with company/org/team priorities, it's my responsibility to show why that is with data and switch to a higher-priority, higher-impact project or propose one. Prioritization is not only critical for your career development (think about performance reviews and promotions), but also for the success of your team and the users of your product.

## Solve the Problem Right 
But of course, your career won't go anywhere if you've spotted and undertaken a right problem but don't get things done. Solving the problem right is *the* core skill across all engineering levels. 

- **Gather requirements**: If you don't know what to build, you can't build it well. For instance, will your new Search models/features apply to retrieval to optimize for Recall, or to re-ranking to boost Precision? The objective determines what data you should use, how to define positives/negatives, and so on. Clarify these requirements with your product manager and engineering partners, and chase after people for more context if need be. Don't assume everyone is on the same page --- after figuring out the crux of the problem, bring everyone to a consensus on the nature and the scope of the product/engineering problem and what ‚Äúdelivered‚Äù really means (e.g., milestones to hit, success metrics to move, and guardrail metrics to watch out for).
- **Evolve with ambiguity**: Sometimes, the starting point is even more ambiguous, especially when you become more senior. For instance, you may be given an abstract goal --- improve search relevance. But how? And how is relevance even defined? In such cases, start an empty design doc with a ‚ÄúRequirements‚Äù section and involve tech leads and stakeholders from relevant (no puns intended ü§£) teams to collect requirements (e.g., what relevance definitions best serve the product goals and user experience, how much Recall or engagement we can sacrifice for relevance, whether to build a separate relevance model or add a relevance head to a multi‚Äëtask model, etc.) and constraints (e.g., which prediction services are available for this use case, the latency budget, where in the Search funnel to apply the model, etc.).
	
	Once requirements and constraints are gathered, leverage your domain expertise to design viable solutions and discuss options in small groups (e.g., tech leads, engineers with most contexts, and people who have a say in approving your design). Before the final design review, you should've already resolved conflicting requirements by labeling some as must-haves and others as nice-to-haves and ensuring your solution immediately satisfies the former and can accommodate the latter in the future. The final review is not a discussion --- you're there to convince people *with data* that the path you propose offers the best trade-off between quality vs. velocity, short-term vs. long-term goals, and so on. 
- **Embrace a leap of faith**: In my 2.5-year tenure at DoorDash, it's crazy how I've worked on multiple subdomains in Search (query understanding, L1/L2 ranking, AutoComplete) as well as domains outside of Search, such as content understanding and P13N. It's crazier that I've launched models in each domain. Every time I took on a new project, I had no way of predicting whether it would be a win or a flop. I used to panic after switching domains but over time, I've learned to embrace a "leap of faith". If I deeply understand the codebase and the user problem, align with stakeholders early, remind myself of ML 101, discuss "silly" ideas with trusted thought partners, and execute tightly and transparently, I can usually improve the system from the baseline in some way. If not, I dive deeper, iterate, or rethink and realign the team with what "success" means for actual users. The courage and ability to start anew make me who I am as an engineer and are essentially what behavioral interviews tap into.
- **Invest in continuous learning**: If all you rely on is a leap of faith, you'll leap into an abyss someday. As ML engineers, we should learn from other teams in the company that face similar problems, stay current to classic and SOTA ML research from academia and industry, and push beyond our comfort zones to understand the system as a whole (e.g., front-end event logging, backend services, platforms, etc.). Sometimes I learn these skills before starting a new project, but more often, I learn them along the way. How we solve a problem right 5 years ago may well differ from how we solve it right today --- so never stop learning.


## Manage Time Wisely
> The worst thing you can do is burn yourself out. Never forget you are your most valuable asset. If you burn yourself out, you will not enjoy what you are doing; you will not be motivated; you will not be learning much; you will get tired faster... --- *Engineer's Survival Guide*, ch. 59, p. 233

Most engineers are busy and many are kind, so it can be a struggle to turn down an ask to focus on higher-priority tasks. Early in my career, being turned down by colleagues I considered friends felt like a personal rejection. Merih Taze's book helped me realize that burning ourselves out is the worst outcome --- if it happens, we can't help anyone. Prioritization is an act of kindness for ourselves and our team.

- **Say no without saying "No"**: Every "Yes" you say to something is a "No" to something else, unless you decide to work 60 hours a week and risk burning out. The PM asks you to explain a model defect; business partners want you to override a model prediction with business logic; leadership wants you to build a model for a new initiative; your tech lead suggests that you refactor a piece of code... The asks are endless in the life of an engineer, so it's important to track your tasks (e.g., in JIRA or a Google Doc), assign priorities (P0/P1/P2), and keep a backlog of things to revisit. When you really must say no to a task now, don't use the word "No" --- instead, let people know that you're willing to help but can only do it after X, Y, and Z are done. Either they'll wait, or they'll find another available engineer to do it.
- **Automate tedious tasks**: Early in my career, I spent about one hour each week taking requests from business and product partners to override a query understanding model's output. This one hour might not seem like much on any given week, but it interrupted my focus time, didn't teach me new skills, and added up over time. In hindsight, I should have automated this task the second time I was asked. If a tedious task becomes a recurring pattern, automate it; if it's a common need, you can "sell" your tool to folks doing similar tasks. It will make a great engineering excellence project to showcase in performance reviews.
- **Set focus blocks**: People will respect it if you set focus blocks during your most productive hours. Use them for the most challenging work, such as writing code for a new model or outlining trade-offs for a new design. However, if your calendar is full of focus blocks, people may find you too unavailable or ignore these blocks and schedule meetings anyway. Use them sparingly.

## Adapt to Changes
> Why is being excited about a situation so important? Because it opens you up instead of closing you down. When fearful, we tend to be protective, pessimistic, ready to right or flee, or jump on the first solution we see. When we are excited, we start having fun with what we are doing. --- *Engineers' Survival Guide*, ch. 8, p. 58

- **See changes as challenges, not problems**: Reorgs, layoffs, attrition, stock drops, etc. --- these are engineers' worst nightmares. You can switch to a more optimistic perspective and see these challenges as opportunities --- reorgs let you learn new parts of the system and build new connections; layoffs either validate the importance of your projects or provide severance for you to find new opportunities with stronger business needs (otherwise, those teams wouldn't be hiring); people quitting lets you drop lower-priority projects you didn't want to own and step up to higher-impact ones; and a lower stock price now means your refresher will be worth more in the future.
- **Be excited about the unknowns**: We talked about this in the ["Solve the Problem Right"](https://www.yuan-meng.com/posts/career_reflection/#solve-the-problem-right) section: Driving ambiguity means gradually eliminating unknowns through discussions and alignment. Good engineers not only have to navigate these unknowns but are excited about them, because it gives them the chance to build new skills and become more well-rounded.

# Talk the Talk

You need to tell people what you've done

Promotion is a combination of skills, impact, and luck. 
Talked to younger engineers --- "doing the right thing" vs. "getting promoted" => if you're doing the right thing in the right place, you should be promoted. And if you're promoted, you have more power to do the right thing. 

## Find the Fun
- welcome challenges & questions
- be likable 
- sourround yourslef with inspiring peopel: author => sick of people being fixated promo + level; but he got to principle in a few years
- pace yourself: stretch, execute, coast

## Find A Mentor
- years of experience in one book 
- a staff engineer liked my blog => i didn't reach out to anyone
- a mentor gives you perspective
- network: people who like you
- manager: talk about career growth explicitly, not just give status report; also learn long-term visions & projects on other teams

## Be an Owner
- find an ownership area and become the go-to person => Knowing how a system works, especially if you know its history, is the most valuable thing you can offer (e.g., serving @ Pinterest)
- unblock yourself
- search before you ask: google, slack, drive, code, wiki
- learn the jargon
- learn popular frameworks
- not your company 
- seek feedback => ask about a specific situation
- be product-mined: care about the prodyct => dogfooding => proactive + curiosity

## Take Initiatives & Risks
> The rush in your veins and that excitement of achieving something is what keeps us motivated [...] I realized I was too scared to fail, so I kept playing it safe [...] Death might sound scarier to you than failing a project, but for me, it was vice versa. --- *Engineers' Survival Guide*, Chapter 30, Page 114

- see an opportunity, run with it
- act, then think => got something to say? say it; want to do something? put the promise out
- don't put eggs in one basket => have a primary and secondary 
- take 2nd proj when 1st one is not risky 

## Being Visible
- share updates
- attend design reviews + leave useful/actionable comments 
- answer in public
- open-source tool, code, and docs
- keep a bragging doc

there's a difference between loud and visible 

## Reach a Consensus
> This is where the conflict starts with people. They are not against your idea; they just do not have enough data about it. The more data you can provide, the easier it will be for them to believe in it. --- *Engineers' Survival Guide*, Chapter 3, Page 9

- bring data to the gun fight
- work on a prototype fast
- odd number of people 
- have small group review first 
- don't use people's brains => use yours
- prevent mtg from getting hijacked: write down questions / objections as TODO in design docs; put it on tasks
- lead people towards your idea using data that you relied yourself to come up with that idea

## Help Effectively
- say no without using the word no --- make the trade offs clear
- 3 times manually => automate + make it an engineering excellence project
- ack & respond reasonably fast

## Give Credit
- promo: hard to exactly --- prevent that from planning; share what people have done 
- the more you give it, the more you will receive => tell to their face + tell to orhers (to use it; mgr)

## Take Responsibilities
- fuck up something? design a better process around it
- people see your shortcomings clearly --- better own up and improve

## Resolve Conflicts
- have empathy (e.g., song in a hurry)
- document conflicts to refer to
- change communication style
- take a break 
- find a different way to contribute to projects
- don't be a conflict person

## Let People Drive
> You cannot keep steering engineers left and right and right and left, hoping to stay perfectly aligned. You need to give them room and just set the direction, measure the speed, and know precisely when you will get to your destination.

- I don't like tight monitoring 
I was putting on snowboarding boots --- if wasn't important for me to wear; it was important for me to learn
When I was onboarding my replacement, I deliberately left the code
