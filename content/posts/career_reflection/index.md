# Foreword: To the Ambitious (and Confused) Early Career Engineers

I had far too chill parents growing up. The first day they dropped me off at school, I had no idea why I was there. I sat quietly, confused, for about a year before realizing there was such a thing as education. Similarly, when I started my first job at DoorDash in Summer 2022 (or shall I say "Q3"), I had far too chill a manager during my first 6 months and only gradually figured out what a career in engineering is all about.

Later, I read [Merih Taze](https://www.engineerssurvivalguide.com/)'s and [Gergely Orosz](https://www.engguidebook.com/)'s witty and pragmatic career books. I've also built a career I'm proud of. This week, I began my second job at Pinterest, one of my dream companies as an ML engineer. Now feels like the perfect time to share lessons from the books and re-imagine how I'd start my career all over again to make an impact more quickly and grow to the next level more painlessly. I share this post with ambitious yet perhaps confused early career engineers.

# Choose A Company

Everyone dreams of working for a company that offers competitive compensation, rapid career growth, excellent work-life balance, high job security, and hopefully visa sponsorship. Such a company may exist, but only before 2022 or in your dreams. If there is one, nobody wants to leave, so headcount can't be created. Something's gotta give.

{{< figure src="https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/nbcj1mzc1zkjbi1d36nsr/Screenshot-2024-12-21-at-11.44.01-PM.png?rlkey=ye7lujw71w0ql5zts1ywavf1x&st=u98le99e&raw=1" caption="No companies hiring right now can satisfy all requirements of a dream job..." width="600">}}

For me, as an immigrant living in an HCOL area, compensation, visa sponsorship, and job security are must-haves. Companies that satisfy these constraints generally fall into 3 categories:

1. **High-growth established companies**: At famously fast-paced companies like Meta and DoorDash, promotions at lower levels (E3 $\rightarrow$ E4 $\rightarrow$ E5) come quickly if you work hard on a core team with business needs, and compensation can be exceptional if you join when the stock price is low. However, WLB may take a toll, as stakeholders and leadership will monitor your work more closely, and you'll likely work on launch after launch non-stop.
2. **High-growth startups**: At top AI startups like OpenAI or Anthropic, base salaries are even higher (e.g., ~$300K for E5, which beats E7 base salaries at most tech companies), but the stock compensation is paper money and WLB is more challenging since the work is more cutting-edge, the teams are smaller, priorities shift frequently, and there are more launches deadlines. 
3. **Stable established companies**: Companies such as LinkedIn, Google, Airbnb, and Pinterest were once known for good WLB and slower promotion to the senior (E5) level (particularly the first two). However, in the current market, the culture has generally become more intense, especially on revenue-generating teams.

When choosing my first job, I had just moved to the other side of the Bay and didn't have many friends around. At the time, my priority was to cram as much engineering knowledge as possible and take on as much work as I could to make up for a lack of direct impact I felt during my PhD. DoorDash was the perfect choice for that phase, and probably Meta would have been as well. Over time, I wanted to grow deeper in one domain, even at the expense of some scope and impact. Some friends thought I was crazy, while others supported the idea that deep domain expertise goes a long way. So, I interviewed with type-2 and type-3 companies. Ultimately, I decided to join a type-3 company because, outside of work, I wanted to explore more of nature, invest more in personal relationships, be more active in sports, and enjoy great food, sights, and conversations. I'm fine with being reasonably busy (~50 hours per week), but a 70-hour week might just be too much. In today's employer's market, we may not have many choices (you'll have more options if you ace interviews; see {{< backlink "mle_interviews" "my post">}} for MLE interview tips). But if there's a chance to decide what to do, be honest about what makes your life more fulfilling as a whole—being a great ML engineer is just a small part of that equation.

# Walk the Walk

Think of your career as an ad --- without proper branding and communication, rarely will someone seek you out; but without substance to support the façade, the "false advertising" will one day lead to a refund (or even a lawsuit). It's not true that if you're not a good engineer, you won't get hired (even up-leveled) or promoted --- plenty of confident, charismatic engineers who don't honestly know their craft survive and thrive. However, as soon as their support {{< sidenote "disappears" >}}Or if someone joins the team with years of hands-on experience in this domain and the authority to speak up.{{< /sidenote >}}, it would be hard for them to stay in their current job, and interviewing into a place full of domain experts won't be easy. 

So, I suppose the most universal path toward building a fruitful engineering career is to actually be a good engineer: one with solid skills who commits to continuous learning, solves problems efficiently and creatively, manages time wisely, adapts to changing priorities willingly, and makes principled trade-offs when the time comes.

## Solve the Right Problem
- **Don't work on projects you know are unimportant**: When you're new to a team or very junior, it's hard to turn down projects assigned to you. The more experienced I become, the more I realize my responsibility is not to a project, but to the KRs ("key results") of my company/org/team --- if I believe a project won't result in the expected impact, it is my responsibility to support my belief with data and ask to switch to a project with a higher priority/impact. This is not just critical for my career development as far as performance reviews and promotions go, but also to my team and the users of my company's product. 
- **Understand company priorities**: The ll-hands; talk to mgr + skip 

## Solve the Problem Right 
- gather requirements
- leap of faith
- continuous learning

## Manage Time Wisely
> Would you get mad at someone for being overworked? Or would you want to help them instead? [...] showing you are willing, and proving you are busy.

- every yes you say is a no to other things
- never actually say no
- find or build tools to automate tedious tasks (override)

## Adapt to Changes
> Why is being excited about a situation so important? Because it opens you up instead of closing you down. When fearful, we tend to be protective, pessimistic, ready to right or flee, or jump on the first solution we see. When we are excited, we start having fun with what we are doing. --- *Engineers' Survival Guide*, Chapter 8, Page 58

- challenges, not problems
- be excited; don't be fearful
- re-org: getting to know new parts of the system
- people quit: time to step up and work on higher impact projects (and get rid of projects you didn't want to own)
- stock price drops: more in the future, as long as it's not wish

## Make Principled Trade-Offs

# Talk the Talk

Promotion is a combination of skills, impact, and luck. 
Talked to younger engineers --- "doing the right thing" vs. "getting promoted" => if you're doing the right thing in the right place, you should be promoted. And if you're promoted, you have more power to do the right thing. 

## Being Visible
- share updates
- attend design reviews + leave useful/actionable comments 
- answer in public
- open-source tool, code, and docs

there's a difference between loud and visible 

## Find A Mentor
- years of experience in one book 
- a staff engineer liked my blog => i didn't reach out to anyone
- a mentor gives you perspective

## Let People Drive
> You cannot keep steering engineers left and right and right and left, hoping to stay perfectly aligned. You need to give them room and just set the direction, measure the speed, and know precisely when you will get to your destination.

- I don't like tight monitoring 
I was putting on snowboarding boots --- if wasn't important for me to wear; it was important for me to learn
When I was onboarding my replacement, I deliberately left the code 

## Align the Team 
> This is where the conflict starts with people. They are not against your idea; they just do not have enough data about it. The more data you can provide, the easier it will be for them to believe in it. --- *Engineers' Survival Guide*, Chapter 3, Page 9

- bring data to the gun fight
- work on a prototype fast
- odd number of people 
- have small group review first 
- don't use people's brains => use yours

## Help Effectively
- say no without using the word no --- make the trade offs clear
- 3 times manually => automate + make it an engineering excellence project

## Give Credit
- promo: hard to exactly --- prevent that from planning; share what people have done 
- the more you give it, the more you will receive => tell to their face + tell to orhers (to use it; mgr)

## Take Responsibilities
- fuck up something? design a better process around it

## Resolve Conflicts
- have empathy (e.g., song in a hurry)
- document conflicts to refer to
- change communication style
- take a break 
- find a different way to contribute to projects
- don't be a conflict person

## Take Initiatives
- see an opportunity, run with it
