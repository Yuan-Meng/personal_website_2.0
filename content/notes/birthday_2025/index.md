I've always been good at chasing, not so good at keeping. Lately, I shared with my therapist a strange fatigue and frustration I experience at Pinterest: now that I'm surrounded by great ML peers---the goal I had last year---I suddenly feel tired, intimidated, and at times unmotivated. Despite DoorDash's "cutthroat" reputation, I had a relatively easier time there, getting by with basic ML knowledge.

*"If life was easy then, why did you choose to make it harder now?"* I couldn't really answer it. It's tempting to say because learning "advanced" skills allows one to work for companies that require such skills, but how about not working for such companies? It's not like compensation increases proportionally with model complexity.

This confusion felt familiar. When I first came to Berkeley, having worked my entire undergrad for that moment, I quickly started to focus on what I lacked rather than what I was so excited to learn. *"It's almost like I like pushing myself to places conducive to learning, only to find that I don't like learning."* I was only half joking to my therapist.

The feeling of lack is constant in the Bay Area---be it career or a hobby, someone is always miles ahead. How fast you climb the career ladder, how much you and your spouse make, etc., are all a competition. Somewhere in this rat race, you forget why you're here.

This March, I started playing tennis regularly again. Back in 2022, I often skipped matches and practices, thinking I'd lose anyway. Inexplicably when I picked up the racket not so long ago, I felt the joy again. I was happy just to escape work for a while, focusing on how my mind and my hand change my game. I started reading random tennis history and watching the greats for fun. Somehow I play better than I did in 2022, being more thoughtful and conscious about what I do and why I do it, not caring about winning and losing.

Last weekend, I was drafting a design and prototyping some code no one has yet to review. I was just happy translating what I read in papers and had in mind into actual model classes. Even the struggle made me feel calm: I was happy now that I've got the chance to learn.

Roger Federer shared how losing his Australian mentor pushed him to play harder, fearing being "a waste of talent" and letting him down. I don't really share that fear. Being better than others is too unimportant to me. As I'm getting older, somehow I appreciate Carlos Alcaraz's approach to his game increasingly more---*"Sometimes I talk to myself about what is most important: if I win or doing great things."*

> If life was easy then, why did you choose to make it harder now?

So let me answer this again: I don't want life to be hard or a breeze. I just don't want my life to slip through my fingers all because it's so easy auto-piloting from what I know. I don't mind a little bit of pain if it' something interesting, new, and entertaining that I go after. So here's my birthday wish this year: <span style="color: #c95917">intentionality</span> and <span style="color: #007b22">thoughtfulness</span> towards what I desire and how I think and act to get there.
