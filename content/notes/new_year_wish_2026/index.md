1. Settle into a job I'd happily stay at for 3+ years.
   - Interviewing is draining and rebuilding trust is costly. Finding a place to stay and grow internally is my first wish for 2026. 
   - Careers aren't one-shot optimizations. Pinterest was objectively the best move I could make in 2024. Now I have a clearer picture of what I want in over a longer horizon: 
     - **Progression**: Either level or meaningful comp bump. A lateral move make no sense in this tricky market.
     - **Frontier-adjacent**: I don't expect to work on frontier ML, but do wish to move to a frontier-adjacent domain, where I can spectate frontier progress and apply it to what I know best, such as LLM as Rec, LLM for Rec, and search.
     - **Stability**: In 2025, our industry has seen many "cool" companies or teams fought and collapsed. Working on a strong product team applying reasonably modern models feels "less cool", but it provides better stability and a more sustainable WLB, which is a must for me.
2. Pick an LLM area and actually go deep and get my hands dirty.
   - I used to think of ranking as my specialty, LLMs as another universe, and "LLM as Rec/LLM for Rec" as a fad. They may well be, but now I find it cool to catch up with fresh ideas.
   - Some thoughts: build a baby [Olmo 3](https://allenai.org/blog/olmo3) (AI2's open-source model), play with [SGLang](https://github.com/sgl-project/sglang), and revisit Cognitive Science + LLMs (e.g., [ReAct](https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.03629) instantly reminded me of CogSci research on planning + learning-to-think and indeed Shunyu Yao was inspired by Tom Griffiths; perhaps some ideas I pondered about as a PhD student now have new answers). 
3. Start playing sports regularly again. 
4. Find a non-ML, non-sports hobby to relax.
5. Finally, finally submit my NIW application and answer any RFEs...
   - **Related to #2**: It's a long shot, but if I do end up having a reasonable Cognitive Science + LLM idea or move to such a team, it'd be great to get published.
6. Travel somewhere in nature. Maybe in Canada. 
7. 📅💍?
