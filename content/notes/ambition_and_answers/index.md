    <ul>
      <li>Your struggle between ambition and meaning feels honest. You’re questioning whether success, better models, or more money actually make you happier.</li>
      <li>You’re noticing that passions change over time, which makes identity feel less anchored.</li>
      <li>The idea that meaning might come from small “sparks” rather than grand ambitions is powerful and grounded.</li>
    </ul>
    The confusions you express — and why they matter:
    <ul>
      <li>Which ambition counts? Having many ambitions is natural, but you ask: “Which one defines me?” That's not a trivial question. If ambitions change, how do you know which one’s your "true" ambition? Or if there even is a "true" one.</li>
      <li>Is ambition itself a reliable anchor? Your piece suggests ambition can become hollow if it’s detached from meaning or internal conviction — for example, when it's driven by external validation or by comparison. This raises a deeper question: Are ambitions fundamentally unstable grounds for identity or meaning?.</li>
      <li>Where does meaning come from? Your reflection echoes what many philosophies and psychologies say: there’s no guaranteed "answer" — or meaning — waiting to be discovered. Instead, maybe meaning must be created internally, through choices, values, and small moments. That uncertainty can be both freeing and frightening.</li>
    </ul>

Friends sometimes ask about my ambitions, like why I seem to be constantly searching for new knowledge or career advancements. And I wonder about that myself: does working on a more popular product, building more powerful or interesting models, or making xx% more money at a higher level make me happier? I don't know.

I was watching [*The Thinking Game*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d95J8yzvjbQ), which reminded me of my childhood dream --- like many former and current Cognitive Scientists, I, too, wondered about the essence of intelligence and how to build one from scratch. That question mattered so much to me as a kid because my childhood revolved around solving problems in order to get myself out of trouble or keep myself entertained. Years ago, I decided not to pursue that question as a researcher. Still, would knowing the answers make me happier? I don't know.

In *Stranger Things* Season 5, Robin told Will that she used to obsess over a girl in her class, thinking getting her attention would give her life meaning. When the girl liked some boy (Steve "The Hair" Harrington) instead, she ceased to believe she could be herself and still be loved. After falling into a period of depression, she found an 8-millimeter film reel she made as a kid and remembered her love for filmmaking and for herself. That's when she realized the answer to life doesn't come from someone else --- the answers have always resided in ourselves.

I was very touched, but didn't fully grasp how finding ambitions leads to finding answers to life. For starters, one can have many ambitions. Which is the life-defining one? Then, ambitions change. I used to obsess over detective novels and metal music as a kid --- my own version of Robin's 8-millimeter films. But would being a detective or metal musician today make me happy? Perhaps not. So I don't know how an ambition anchors someone to who they are through the years.

But I do resonate with Robin's past feelings that someone else's attention made her feel seen, as if everything random and mundane in life suddenly had meaning and made sense. I have felt that way. But after a while, you stop being curious for the sake of curiosity and start to optimize your curiosities for external affirmation. It's like a model that stops learning world knowledge and becomes addicted to optimizing a benchmark. The fear of loss dominates growth.

I'm not so sure if anyone or anything would suddenly give you an answer that grounds your life. Maybe the answer lies in none of the things above --- ambitions, curiosities, or attention --- or maybe all of them combined. Maybe growing up means accepting that sadness and boredom are the norm and completely fine, and that it's those little sparks that we live for --- like an enjoyable conversation with a good friend, a nice finding at work, a tasty dish, or a beautiful scenery that lights up life for a moment, a minute, or a day. There's no such thing as moving forward or backward in life, since it's not a race. The meaning of life might just be staying alive while keeping our eyes peeled and minds open to those random, unpredictable sparks as they arrive.
