I recently talked with two friends about why people make New Year wishes --- or any wishes at all --- when we don't really believe in fairies, fate, or higher powers that will grant our wishes. Then I realized the real power of a wish might just lie in setting an **arbitrary deadline** for what we need or want to do in life.

When I'm too tired to take out the trash or do laundry, I’'l set a 17-minute alarm (17 is my favorite number since childhood). If the task doesn't take 17 minutes, I take a rest before or after. If it takes longer, I simply ignore the alarm. This little deadline helps me forget my tiredness for a moment and get things done.

Friends who know me know that I had wanted to switch jobs for a while but was afraid of LeetCode. I figured I might bomb interviews no matter how hard I studied. Then I gave myself deadlines for smaller, more concrete tasks: list crucial data structures and algorithms (January 2024), solve three problems per topic (February), and practice classic plus company-tagged problems (March 2024). I got my first desirable offer in March 2024 --- just in time for H1-B filing (though I stayed put for personal reasons). Setting those deadlines turned an intimidating goal into routine tasks, exactly like what we handle daily at work.

It doesn't matter if you make a wish on December 31, January 3, or March 15. What matters is discovering and being true to what you desire and adding a deadline to it. The more concrete and actionable your wish, the more likely you'll grant it yourself. The accuracy of the deadline itself doesn't matter at all. 

Since my F-1 visa expired in mid-2021 and my H1-B activated in late 2024, I couldn't travel abroad --- even though it's my favorite thing in the world since I was a kid. My top wish in 2025 is to travel outside the U.S., maybe visiting the beautiful Pinterest office in Dublin, Ireland. To do so, I will need to:

- Apply for a Canadian visa & schedule stamping (January 2025): My old Canadian visa expired with my old passport. I’ll apply for a new one and make a future stamping appointment.
- Onboarding (March 2025): Get settled at work so I can confidently take time off.
- H1-B stamping (March 2025): Travel to Canada for the scheduled interview.
- Apply for an Ireland visa (April 2025): Submit a short-stay application.

Each step is still a moving piece, but if I only had a vague desire to travel, I'd never start. I also want to make more friends through mutual hobbies, explore nature, resume therapy and gender affirmation, become a stronger ML engineer in deep learning ranking, among a few others. I put these wishes on a Notion page and attached artificial deadlines, the same way I tackled my interviews (coding, system design, behavioral, etc.).

To my friends: I hope you fulfill your heart's desires in 2025 (the "arbitrary deadline"). Be honest about what makes you happy, then attach deadlines and actions to make it real.
