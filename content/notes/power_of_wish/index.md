I spoke with friends about why people make New Year wishes --- or wishes at all --- if we don't believe in fairies, fate, or higher powers that will grant our wishes. Then I realized <span style="background-color: #abe0bb">the power of a wish might just lie in setting an arbitrary deadline for what we need or want in life</span>.

When I'm too tired to take out the trash or do laundry, I'll set a {{< sidenote "17" >}}No reason, but only because 17 is my favorite number.{{< /sidenote >}}-minute alarm. If the task doesn't take 17 minutes, I can take a breather; if it takes longer, I can ignore the alarm. This little deadline helps me forget my tiredness so I can get things done and move on.

Friends close to me know that I had wanted to jump ship for a while but was afraid of LeetCode. I figured I might bomb interviews no matter how hard I studied, so I didn't study hard. Things only began to change after I gave myself deadlines for smaller, more concrete tasks: e.g., make a list of key data structures and algorithms to master (January 2024), solve 3â€“5 problems per topic (February 2024), and practice classic plus company-tagged problems (March 2024). I got my first desirable offer in March 2024 but stayed for personal reasons.

Somehow, setting a deadline turns a tiring, intimidating goal into a normal, routine task that we handle daily (like a JIRA ticket). It doesn't matter if you make a New Year wish on December 31, January 3, or March 15; even the deadline you create is unimportant. The trick is this: if you're unhappy with your life or think something might make you happier, be honest about it, and attach a deadline so you have some sense of urgency and responsibility. The actions that come from that urgency and responsibility are the fairies that grant your wish.

In 2024, people often asked how I wrote these blog posts. The truth is, I sometimes just came up with a title and wrote down a deadline (i.e., the weekend I might be free) before I even read a single paper on a topic. When the time came, I searched for relevant papers and read them at the same time as I wrote down key ideas in my empty post.

In 2025, one of my top wishes is to travel outside of the United States. Traveling was my favorite thing as a kid, yet I wasn't able to leave the US after my F-1 visa expired in mid-2021 and before my H1-B activated in late 2024. In 2025, maybe I'll visit the beautiful Pinterest office in Dublin, Ireland. Below are some arbitrary deadlines:

- **Apply for a Canadian visa & schedule stamping** (January 2025): My old Canadian visa expired with my old passport. I'll apply for a new one and make an H1-B stamping appointment.
- **Onboarding** (March 2025): Ramp up so I feel safe to take time off.
- **H1-B stamping** (March 2025):  Visit Canada for the H1-B stamp.
- **Apply for an Ireland visa** (April 2025): Apply for a short-stay Irish visa and work in the Dublin office for one or two weeks. 

Each step is a moving piece, but if all I have is a vague desire to travel, I'd never get started. Besides traveling, in 2025, I want to make more friends through hobbies, explore more of nature, resume therapy and gender affirmation, and become a competent ML engineer in deep learning ranking, among other personal goals. I put these wishes on a Notion page and attached artificial deadlines, the same way I tackled ML interviews (e.g., coding, system design, behavioral, etc.).

To my friends: I hope you fulfill your heart's desires in 2025 (the "arbitrary deadline") by being honest about what makes you happy, and then attach deadlines and actions to make it real.
