The summer of 2016 when *Stranger Things* Season 1 came out, I was a month away from leaving home to start my PhD in the States. I had just parted from my college classmates and professors, some of whom I really liked, and returned to my childhood home that felt so lonely and empty. Yet I was hopeful about what the future might hold, about the possibility of being accepted for who I am in a faraway land. 

The show was a love at first sight. I had always enjoyed coming-of-age stories of small-town kids having adventures together. As a child, I had vivid imaginations, picturing a whole world full of gods and monsters beyond my bedroom wall. I was 22 when I first watched *Stranger Things*, but childhood didn't feel that far away. I was immersed in the adventures of the Hawkins kids. When they rode their bikes across town under the *Kids* score, I was deeply moved by the imagery of "天阶夜色凉如水" ("the steps of the celestial palace, bathed in night, are cool as flowing water"), and my warm imagination of American towns.

Then I moved to the States. With each season, I grew up a little. In October 2017 (Season 2), I met my two best friends since moving to the U.S., after a lonesome first semester. In July 2019 (Season 3), the first person accepted my gender identity and sexuality without question and still loved me for who I am. In May 2022 (Season 4), I graduated from grad school, wrapping up what had felt like an impossible PhD journey. And in November 2025 (Season 5), I found myself burned out by the repetitiveness of work, frequently questioning the meaning of life and grappling with the fear of aging.

Those nine years seem to have flown by --- without logic, plans, or meaning. And yet, they were the most transformative years of my life.

I was deeply saddened by the last scene, when Mike leaves the basement to make room for Holly and co. to play. A comment I read struck me with such nostalgia: "The show is over, ending with the childhood of a generation. The new story now belongs to the next." Thought that life is irreversible was so powerful, so cruel. Childhood, young adulthood --- these moments are experienced only once. When our time comes, we'll make room for the next group of kids.  

I finally understood this line from *Boyhood*: "We don't seize the moment. It's the other way around --- the moment seizes us." All my life, a core belief is that I could always do something about anything; I could problem solve out of any trouble. But life isn't a problem, and it cannot be resolved. Perhaps the key to acceptance is to let go of the urge to do something, and just let the moment seize us. Every moment in the past is gone and lost. Every moment ahead still awaits.
