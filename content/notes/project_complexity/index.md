Most people don't build rackets at work. Even if they do, most likely they don't build one from scratch. So how do we showcase project complexity in a promo packet or a behavioral interview?

Lately, I came across 3 great posts ([1](https://www.1point3acres.com/bbs/thread-1150382-1-1.html), [2](https://www.1point3acres.com/bbs/thread-1107824-1-1.html), [3](https://www.1point3acres.com/bbs/thread-652478-1-1.html)) and would love to summarize the lessons.

First of all, there are three types of complexity (see [post](https://www.1point3acres.com/bbs/thread-1107824-1-1.html)):
1. **Collaboration complexity**: x-org/x-functional collaboration > projects within well-defined team scope & done alone
2. **Ambiguity**: e.g. 0 ⇒ 1 projects > well-established projects
3. **Technical complexity**: complex systems (many components involved, legacy dependencies, new systems, hidden bugs...), scaling challenges (high QPS ⇒ low latency), tool challenges (too few vs. too many choices), maintenance challenges (strict SLAs, tech debts...), chasing SOTA (when incremental changes bring only marginal model improvements)...

Behavioral interviews are conversational and story-based. Rather than listing bullet points, so you should plant the above signals your interviewer needs to hear in a captivating story with twists and turns:

<details>
<summary><b>Chapter 1: Design</b></summary>

- Who are the users of your project? What's the significance of this project? Why now?  
- How did you gather requirements?  
- How did you design the solution? Which choices did you have? How did you decide on the trade-offs?  

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Chapter 2: Development</b></summary>

- Which issues did you encounter during development?  
- Were there difficult communications within or across teams?  
- How did you align everyone on the same page when there were different opinions about project goals, execution strategies, design choices, or something else?  
- How did you keep stakeholders updated and happy?  

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Chapter 3: Launch</b></summary>

- What issues did you face when trying to launch the project?  
- Did you encounter any bugs? How did you root-cause and fix them — especially hard ones that others couldn't seem to solve?  
- Did you pay off tech debts if you incurred any?  

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Chapter 4: Learnings</b></summary>

- What did you learn from the project? What best practices came out of it? Did you give a tech talk to share across teams?  
- What were the biggest pain points of your new system compared to the old one or an ideal one? How did you address them?  

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Chapter 5: Expansion</b></summary>

- What's the next step for your project?  
- How would you do things differently next time?  
- How did you get funding or buy-in for the next version?  

</details>


The interviewer doesn't really know how complicated your project was --- they've never worked on it themself. They can only infer the complexity from the technical (e.g., complex designs, tricky implementations, deeply hidden bugs) and non-technical (e.g., collaborating with many people, especially when you need to persuade them) challenges you faced. If you can overcome those challenges with first-principal reasoning, strong execution, and clear communication --- and learn from the experience --- they shall believe you will lead a new team to success, come hell or high water.
