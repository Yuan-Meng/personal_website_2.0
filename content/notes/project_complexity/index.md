Most people don't build rockets at work. Even if they do, most likely they don't build one from scratch. So how do we showcase project complexity in a promo packet or a behavioral interview?

Lately, I came across three great posts ([1](https://www.1point3acres.com/bbs/thread-1150382-1-1.html), [2](https://www.1point3acres.com/bbs/thread-1107824-1-1.html), [3](https://www.1point3acres.com/bbs/thread-652478-1-1.html)) and would like to summarize the lessons. Bottom line: It's not about making up things you haven't done, but narrating them with "complexity signals".

# Types of Complexity

First of all, there are three types of complexity (see [post](https://www.1point3acres.com/bbs/thread-1107824-1-1.html)):
1. **Collaboration complexity**: x-org/x-functional collaboration > projects within well-defined team scope & done alone
2. **Ambiguity**: e.g., 0 ⇒ 1 projects > well-established projects; projects for which you created the roadmap > assigned projects
3. **Technical complexity**: complex systems (many components involved, legacy dependencies, new systems, hidden bugs...), scaling challenges (high QPS ⇒ low latency), tooling challenges (too few vs. too many choices), maintenance challenges (strict SLAs, tech debts...), timeline challenges (tight deadline vs. engineering quality + science rigor), chasing SOTA (when incremental changes bring only marginal model improvements)...

Behavioral interviews are conversational and story-based. Rather than listing bullet points, you should plant above signals your interviewer needs to hear in a captivating story with twists and turns:

<details>
<summary><b>Chapter 1: Design</b></summary>

- Who are the users of your project? What's the significance of this project? Why do it now, not before or later?  
- How did you gather requirements (functional, non-functional, logistical) from all interested parties?  
- How did you design the solution? Which choices have you considered? How did you decide on the trade-offs?  

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Chapter 2: Development</b></summary>

- Which issues did you encounter during development?  
- Were there difficult communications within or across teams?  
- How did you align everyone on the same page when there were different opinions about project goals, execution strategies, design choices, or something else?  
- Were there any risks of missing the promised timeline? What did you do to derisk the launch (e.g., changing scope, adding people, extend timeline, etc.)?
- How did you keep stakeholders updated and happy?  

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Chapter 3: Launch</b></summary>

- What issues did you face when trying to launch the project?  
- Did you encounter any bugs? How did you root-cause and fix them — especially hard ones that others couldn't seem to solve?  
- Did you pay off tech debts if you incurred any?  

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Chapter 4: Learnings</b></summary>

- What did you learn from the project? What best practices came out of it? Did you give a tech talk or use other forums to share knowledge within & across teams?  
- What were the biggest pain points of your new system compared to the old one or an ideal one? How did you address them?  

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Chapter 5: Expansion</b></summary>

- How would you do things differently next time?  
- What's the next step for your project? How does it fit into the long-term vision of your org?
- How did you get funding or buy-in for the next version?  

</details>

The interviewer can't really know how complicated your project was --- they've never worked on it themself. They can only infer the complexity from the technical (e.g., complex designs, tricky implementations, deeply hidden bugs) and non-technical (e.g., collaborating with many people, especially when you need to persuade them) challenges you mentioned. If you can overcome those challenges with first-principal reasoning, strong execution, and clear communication --- and learn from the experience --- they shall believe you will lead a new team to success, come hell or high water.
