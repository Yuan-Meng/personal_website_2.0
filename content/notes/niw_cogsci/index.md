# First Thing First: Believe

Most of us started our PhD believing our work mattered to humanity, not just one nation. I did when I dreamt of becoming a cognitive scientist, believing my field held the key to what makes us human and how intelligence comes to be. Like many, I found a career in the tech industry that better fit my personality and goals. Somewhere along the way, I forgot why I dreamt the cognitive science (CogSci) dream.

Moving on from grad school is perfectly fine --- until the [PERM](https://forumtogether.org/article/explainer-perm-labor-certification-process/) struggle makes making a case for the national importance of our work one of the few options to stay in the United States. I don't believe choosing a career outside academia makes our past work any less important. I see the NIW petition as a fun challenge, a chance for me to consider what work I can realistically pursue at this stage of life to advance CogSci + AI --- now that I'm a bit older, hopefully wiser, and know a lot more about AI/ML than when I was a CogSci researcher.

A big flaw in my personality is that I can't do anything unless I believe in its meaning. I can't prepare for interviews unless I believe it will make me a better engineer. I can't prepare for an NIW case unless I believe what I've done or am about to do has national importance. So I often go a long way in search of that meaning: spending an insane number of hours reading and thinking about ML engineering, or in this case, cognitively inspired AI, even though I know there are many shortcuts to take (e.g., memorizing answers to the most likely questions, or sketching out a research agenda that sounds reasonable on paper but has little chance of becoming real). This need to believe makes me who I am and is the motivation behind this article.

There are many excellent NIW examples in the natural sciences --- check out Andrey Solovyev's informative [website](https://andreychemist.github.io/)! As far as I know, mine is one of the first posts on CogSci NIW petitions. This post is a work in progress, and I'll keep updating it as I prepare my case.
