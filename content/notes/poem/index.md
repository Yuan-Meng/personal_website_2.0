I loved it when you invited me in; <br/> you giggled when I tickled you and pretended to smother you with your beloved bed sheet. <br/> I examined your eyes, acne, and lips so closely, <br/> as if I was trying to register your everything in my brain. <br/> We chatted about how you got your orange-legged glasses in high school <br/> and put them on in a haste before morning meetings. <br/> So many little things that I never thought of or cared about <br/> suddenly mattered because of you.
