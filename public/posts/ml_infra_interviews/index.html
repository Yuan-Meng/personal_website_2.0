 (e.g., OpenAI, Anthropic, xAI, Google DeepMind, Reflection), the first two pay (far) more than most at the same level. Many solid MLEs are incentivized to pass their interviews at some point in their careers.</p>
<p>ML system design focuses on translating business objectives into ML objectives, choosing training data, labels, and model architectures, and evaluating models offline and online. By contrast, <span style="background-color: #D9CEFF">ML infra system design focuses on the offline + online pipelines that support an ML system</span>. One type of question asks you to walk through full online + offline pipelines; another asks you to design specific components, such as a feature store, real-time feature updates, or distributed training.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s the funny thing: If your company serves truly large-scale recommender systems (e.g., recommending billions of items to hundreds of millions of DAUs), you&rsquo;re likely working with dedicated infra teams that handle logging, training, and inference for you. Your job is to optimize a narrow set of North Star metrics your team is funded for (e.g., CTR, CVR, revenue, search relevance). If your company isn&rsquo;t making recommendations at scale, the knowledge of how to build scalable ML systems may be years away from your reality.</p>
<p>That said, I do think ML infra interviews are valuable: modern recommender system teams function like Formula One teams &mdash; even if you ask Max Verstappen to build a car, he couldn&rsquo;t do it to save his life, but no driver on the grid doesn&rsquo;t have an intimate knowledge of car mechanics. The best drivers have a fantastic feel for which parts are or aren&rsquo;t working and collaborate with technicians to improve the car throughout a season. Similarly, the best ML engineers can make necessary, timely, and reasonable requests of their ML infra partners well ahead of major projects. Solid ML infra knowledge goes a long way in an impactful career. So even if you never take an ML infra interview, you should still spend time learning this knowledge.</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Data ingestion</strong>: consume training data (features + labels + metadata) either all at once or in a streaming fashion 👉 preprocess the data so they&rsquo;re ready to be fed into the model
<ul>
<li><em>Batching</em>: we usually can&rsquo;t load the entire training set at once 👉 split it into mini-batches and train on one batch at a time</li>
<li><em>Sharding</em>: extremely large datasets may not fit on a single machine 👉 shard data across multiple machines and let each worker consume from some shards</li>
<li><em>Caching</em>: if we read data from a remote source (e.g., a database or datalake) or have expensive preprocessing, we can cache preprocessed data in RAM for future epochs</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Model training</strong>: initialize a model, train it on ingested data in a distributed way (data or model parallel), and write out checkpoints
<ul>
<li>How to distribute model training
<ul>
<li><em>Distributed data parallel (DDP)</em>: copy the model to multiple workers 👉 each worker consumes data and computes gradients independently 👉 aggregate gradients (e.g., sum them) to update parameters</li>
<li><em>Distributed model parallel (DMP)</em>: if a huge model can&rsquo;t fit in one worker&rsquo;s memory (e.g., hundreds of Transformer blocks), split the model across workers 👉 each worker consumes source data or upstream outputs to compute gradients and update the parameters it owns</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>How to ensure eventual consistency
<ul>
<li><em>Use parameter severs</em>: a parameter server stores the authoritative model parameters 👉 workers push gradients to it, the server applies updates, and workers pull the latest parameters before training the next batch</li>
<li><em>Collective communication via <code>allreduce</code> (<code>reduce + broadcast</code>)</em>: each worker computes gradients independently 👉 aggregate gradients across workers (<code>reduce</code>) 👉 send the aggregated gradients back to all workers so they can update parameters (<code>broadcast</code>)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Model serving</strong>: load a trained model and use it to make predictions for new inputs (realtime or batched fashion)
<ul>
<li><em>Replication</em>: to handle high many concurrent queries with low latency, replicate the model across multiple model servers and use a load balancer to distribute traffic evenly</li>
<li><em>Sharding</em>: if a request is too large for a single worker and can be decomposed (e.g., frame-level video understanding) 👉 distribute sub-requests to shards 👉 aggregate results</li>
<li><em>Even-driven processing</em>: in systems with strong surge patterns (e.g., Uber ride requests, Airbnb bookings), create a shared resource pool that processes can borrow from during peak hours (with a rate limiter to prevent resource exhaustion)</li>
</ul>
</li>

<p>A design interview is a perfect venue to showcase leadership, time management, and communication skills, on top of  domain knowledge.</p>
<p>An ML infra system has many moving parts (like all distributed systems do) &mdash; from generating and validating training data, scheduling training, to handling high QPS how it makes the most sense for your product, to name a few. You need a coherent story to tie those little pieces together and gotta sell your story telling to your interviewer. You must be assertive when the interviewer doesn&rsquo;t have a strong preference, but flexible when they do. That&rsquo;s what leadership is: influencing without authority and staying open-minded to different ideas.</p>
<p>Last but not least, painting a high-level picture is far from enough &mdash; you must identify and deep dive into the most interesting parts of your system, rather than dwelling on mundane or trivial parts. That&rsquo;s where your time management instincts and domain knowledge shine.</p>

<p>Many books have been written on either machine learning or distributed systems. However, there is currently no book available that talks about the combination of both and bridges the gap between them. &mdash; <em>Distributed Machine Learning Patterns</em></p>

<ol>
<li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Distributed-Machine-Learning-Patterns-Yuan/dp/1617299022">Distributed Machine Learning Patterns</a> 👉 this is a <em>fantastic</em> book about ML infra. Some folks dismiss it because the author still uses (1) TensorFlow and (2) the Fashion-MINST dataset to illustrate the model component, but I bet they didn&rsquo;t read the book.
<ul>
<li>(1) is understandable because the author was a main contributor of <em>Google</em>&rsquo;s Kubeflow. Do we expect PyTorch? 🤣</li>
<li>(2) is the point &mdash; the author wants readers to build an end-to-end ML infra system on their own machine and has provided probably the cleanest and most vividly explained instructions on how to do so. A toy dataset is what fits.</li>
