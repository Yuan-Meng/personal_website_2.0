<p>I have always loved how Dustin from <em>Stranger Things</em> says &ldquo;here goes nothing&rdquo; before executing an impossible plan. According to <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/etymology/comments/3iwni1/here_goes_nothing/">Reddit</a>, this phrase means &ldquo;you have nothing left to lose&rdquo; or that &ldquo;even if it fails, you don&rsquo;t lose anything of value&rdquo;. That&rsquo;s probably the mindset to have when interviewing with companies everybody wants to join.</p>

, Pinterest, and LinkedIn have established ranking teams, good compensation, and standard &ldquo;ML design + LeetCode + behavior&rdquo; interview rounds. I wrote about how to tackle standard MLE interviews in my previous <a href="/posts/mle_interviews/" class="backlink">post</a>
  
  .</p>
<p>For <strong>applied/non-research</strong> ML or research engineers, only a few places can pay more than the above at the same level: research engineers at {xAI, OpenAI, Anthropic, Google DeepMind, Microsoft AI} and ML engineers at {Snap, Databricks, Netflix, Roblox}. Most of these companies have interview rounds I find genuinely scary &mdash; for instance:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>ML infra design</strong>: I&rsquo;m <strong>not</strong> talking about ML system design focusing on modeling, where you can briefly mention sharding, caching, etc. to show your &ldquo;scaling&rdquo; awareness. That would be easy by now. I&rsquo;m talking about ML <strong>infra</strong> design that doesn&rsquo;t focus on modeling at all, but instead asks in great detail about the infra around ML systems, such as feature stores, distributed training, and online serving. Such interviews are rare, but they happen to be a required round at companies like Netflix, Snap, Reddit, DoorDash, Notion, and so on. I recently wrote a <a href="/posts/ml_infra_interviews/" class="backlink">blogpost</a>
  
   on how to prepare for this rare but critical round (rather than giving up).</li>
<li><strong>Multi-level object-oriented programming</strong>: You&rsquo;ll implement a toy system that mimics a real-world backend system, such as a database, a KV store, a chat room, a game, to name a few. You&rsquo;ll start with basic methods and gradually add more or scale up.</li>
<li><strong>LLM coding</strong>: A few years ago, many companies liked to ask candidates to implement a simple model (e.g., KNN, K-means, decision trees, logistic regression, linear regression, MLP) from scratch or load a scikit-learn model and fit it on toy data. Today, frontier labs might ask you to debug or implement language model training or inference code &mdash; e.g., Transformer encoders/decoders, KV cache, LoRA, or even <a href="https://docs.pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/blitz/autograd_tutorial.html">autograd</a>.
<ul>
<li><em>Why scary</em>: Even people who use PyTorch daily rarely know low-level details like how computation graphs are built or how autograd works under the hood. When it comes to model architectures, we may know KNN and attention well in isolation, but don&rsquo;t immediately realize how the latter is a softer version of the former. These are just a few examples. Deep down, the real signal is understanding modern deep learning &ldquo;primitives&rdquo; inside out. Perhaps the ideal candidate is an ML PhD student who has just passed their qualifying exams. The rest of us can try our best but still miss the mark.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Research presentation</strong>: In traditional project deep dives, you verbally walk through one or two representative projects. Some Research Engineer roles require a job talk style presentation on your past work. You make ~10 slides, go over technical details, and &ldquo;defend&rdquo; your body of work like a PhD candidate would.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you think these rounds are daunting, so does everyone else. Mayuko explained in an awesome <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2Y-rhTlHHI">YouTube video</a> that tech interviews once focused on domain knowledge; then Microsoft popularized domain-agnostic data structures and algorithms problems to give raw talents from all backgrounds a fair chance. For a while, SWE candidates found those interviews scarier than domain knowledge &mdash; until LeetCode came along and gave everyone an efficient way to prepare.</p>
<p>Today, new interview formats feel daunting because they don&rsquo;t have a LeetCode-equivalent yet. We&rsquo;re the pioneers. When doing &ldquo;standard&rdquo; ML interviews back in 2024, my goal was converting every onsite interview into an offer. For research engineering roles with scarier rounds, I&rsquo;ve come to realize that we may not get what we want on the first try, but it&rsquo;s worth learning what we need to there next time :)</p>

<p>To do well at MLE interviews 2.0, we inevitably lose some productivity at work, so think clearly about why you wanna leave (every recruiter and hiring manager will ask you anyways). Once you start, commit to finishing in 2 months with full determination. Dragging it out hurts your sleep and work performance. You&rsquo;re more ready than you think.</p>
<p>Under normal circumstances, new hires don&rsquo;t work on high-impact projects right away, and many don&rsquo;t survive long enough to ever take on one. If you&rsquo;re already in a rare position to lead high-impact projects continuously, you&rsquo;ll find yourself in a worse situation at 99% new companies. Don&rsquo;t leave such a job without a compelling reason.</p>
<p>I was lucky to take on high-visibility, top-down projects shortly after joining Pinterest. So for me to leave, I <span class="sidenote">

</h4>
<p>I used to have an accurate hunch for when an offer was coming. Now I don&rsquo;t know anymore. When I last interviewed in mid-2024, I rigorously followed people&rsquo;s (and my own) advice &mdash; solving coding problems cleanly and quickly, organizing ML system design answers in a &ldquo;perfect&rdquo; structure (e.g., clarifications 👉 business goals 👉 ML objectives 👉 high-level ranking funnel 👉 blah blah), and telling polished behavior stories in impeccable <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Situation,_task,_action,_result">STAR</a> or <a href="https://phyllisnjoroge.medium.com/the-sail-framework-for-behavioral-interview-questions-f66e56eee91a">SAIL</a> frameworks.</p>
<p>At the end of 2025 and the start of 2026, I did onsite interviews with $N \in [5, 10)$ companies and had imperfections here and there (e.g., bombed some coding questions, gave long-winded answers in behavior interviews, focused too much on certain parts of a design and ran out of time). Yet I received offers from $(N-1)$ of them. The only onsite I failed was for a backend role (shouldn&rsquo;t have got that far).</p>
<p>Is the bar getting lower? Definitely not. The only onsite I failed was one where I sort of did &ldquo;perfectly&rdquo; &mdash; I solved all hard coding problems, delivered structured system designs, and told well-rehearsed behavior stories. But my experience didn&rsquo;t match &mdash; I&rsquo;m an ML engineer with an understanding of backend systems, and the team were looking for a backend engineer with ranking knowledge. I doubted if I could do the job, and indeed I didn&rsquo;t get the job. I think <span style="background-color: #D9CEFF">the bar is getting more based on match</span> &mdash; headcount is so tight in this market that hiring teams must answer this question: <span style="background-color: #D9CEFF"><em>&ldquo;Why you? Why not anyone else?&rdquo;</em></span></p>
<p>I think my strength lies in the fact that I haven&rsquo;t spent a single day since 2022 not thinking about or reading papers on recommender systems. I&rsquo;m fascinated by every aspect of RecSys. It&rsquo;s what I do and what I love. For instance, how do we build value models? If we use a single label source (e.g., user engagement), we may end up optimizing for that one objective. But if we combine multiple label sources, then label weights themselves are exactly what we try to tune when combining predictions. And how do we train early-stage rankers when most responses are not impressed and therefore unlabeled? If we distill from a late-stage ranker, is that late-stage ranker itself good enough to make predictions for unranked examples (i.e., those never returned by the early-stage ranker)? How do we handle such data drifts? Just to name a few. Even when I managed time badly in a design interview (i.e., not finishing up the ranking funnel), what I did say might&rsquo;ve still shown what I&rsquo;ve thought deeply about in my day-to-day job. I don&rsquo;t know how, but interviewers must have spotted that.</p>
<p>My honest advice: Find a domain you love from the bottom of your heart and apply to roles in that domain. This way, you worry less about &ldquo;the bar&rdquo; and focus more on finding a place that shares your passion.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, below is what to aim for if you want to do &ldquo;perfectly&rdquo;.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Coding</strong>: As an MLE/RE candidate, you may get a funny experience of writing a toy backend API yesterday, implementing a Transformer decoder today, and solving an LC hard tomorrow &mdash; all with the expectation to be fast, optimal, and thoughtful. Some friends complain about such expectations, saying (almost) no one in real life is at once a backend genius, a SOTA model creator, and a competitive programmer. I just accept these requirements as reality, swallow the pain, and try my best to prepare and perform.
<ul>
<li><strong>LC</strong>: If an LC-style interview is 45 minutes, you will likely solve 1 Easy + 1 Medium or 2 Medium problems in a Meta interview, or 1 Hard problem with multiple follow-ups in a Google/Snap/Pinterest/Databricks/etc. interview. In the Meta case, the ideal outcome is to instantly think of the solution upon seeing the prompt, explain the solution in 2-3 min, code it up in 5-8 min, and do a dry run in 1-2 min. In the latter cases, the ideal outcome is to write a working solution within 20 minutes, create and pass sharp test cases, and discuss optimizations. For follow-ups, you&rsquo;re expected to provide extendable solutions in code or words. If no follow-ups, it means you&rsquo;ve spent too long on the main problem.</li>
<li><strong>OOP</strong>: In a 1-hour OOP-style interview, you&rsquo;ll implement a toy API to play a game, manage a database or a process, etc.. Problems are typically organized by levels. The first level is a warmup. Then you gradually expand the API in subsequent levels. The ideal candidate not just has a good pace to finish all levels, but also make reasonable design choices for a real-world backend system. It&rsquo;s good to leave some time in the end to discuss how to scale this toy system in production.</li>
<li><strong>ML</strong>: In a 1-hour ML coding interview, you&rsquo;re given some model code (e.g., model classes, training and inference loops) and asked to debug bad performance, or you implement a model from scratch using NumPy/PyTorch and overfit it on toy samples. Many candidates spend too long reading the code provided or Googling NumPy/PyTorch syntax. An ideal candidate is fluent in PyTorch or NumPy and can code up common architectures (e.g., MLP, CNN, RNN, Transformer encoders/decoders) and building blocks (e.g., linear layers, projections, residual connections, layer norm, batch norm, causal self-attention, bidirectional self-attention, activation functions, optimizers) from memory. Excessive Googling leaves you no time to debug or implement the model.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>ML system design</strong>: By now, everyone knows how to sketch a multi-stage ranking pipeline &mdash; L0 (candidate generation) 👉 L1 (first-stage ranking) 👉 L2 (second-stage ranking) 👉 L3 (call it re-ranking, value model, or &ldquo;special effects&rdquo;). If you sound like everyone else, that won&rsquo;t cut it anymore. You need full control of the conversation: use the ranking funnel as scaffolding, but show insights that only a RecSys expert would have. Bring ideas and solutions from your work (e.g., you&rsquo;ve worked on lifelong sequence models and they are actually a good choice here) and industry frontiers (e.g., this year&rsquo;s standouts are perhaps Kuaishou&rsquo;s &ldquo;One&rdquo; series or <a href="/posts/generative_recommendation/" class="backlink">generative recommendation</a>
  
   in general). That said, only bring up a solution if it solves a real problem (e.g., scaling up, cold start), not because you know it.</li>
<li><strong>Project deep dive</strong>: I&rsquo;ve got one offer because the team needed someone to work on X, and I happened to have worked on X. In this case, my first interviewer was so interested in X that they skipped the coding question and interviewers in the next few rounds ditched the agenda to ask me more about X. If you work on models with broad industry applications and your team is ahead of the industry, you have a natural advantage over very well-prepared candidates who don&rsquo;t have such experience. I think this is why you need to choose your current projects or next moves carefully &mdash; as an ML engineer, try to choose a company that has the same or a more advanced ML stack as your current one; only move to a company with a <span class="sidenote">

However, if a company doesn't use DL, has no plan to support DL, and won't benefit from DL, then think twice before joining, however much you like their product. In a few years when you interview again, perhaps for a frontier AI lab or a more mature company, you can speak to scope but won't capture sufficient interests in deep dives, research presentations, or team matches. Your future career may be limited to designer-driven, pre-IPO companies.<span class="sr-only">)</span>
  </small>

 ML stack if you get a once-in-a-lifetime level bump (e.g., +2) or a package that keeps you happy for the rest of your career. Otherwise, you&rsquo;re cashing out too early and losing your edge in 2-3 years. That said, you can still fail if you talk about a complex project in a trivial manner. I wrote a <a href="https://www.yuan-meng.com/notes/project_complexity/">post</a> on how to do complex projects justice in deep dives.</li>
<li><strong>ML fundamentals</strong>: Most of the time, you&rsquo;ll get 3–5 rapid-fire ML fundamentals questions in a phone screen, often before coding. Many candidates are confused when they fail, remembering they&rsquo;ve solved the coding question perfectly, only to forget that they made fundamental mistakes on ML fundamentals. One or two wrong answers can be enough for rejection. And if those 5 minutes already feels exposing, know that some companies have one or two 45-minute onsite rounds that keep asking ML fundamentals to test the limit of your deep learning knowledge.</li>
<li><strong>Behavior and leadership</strong>: It&rsquo;s hard to reflect on your career while you&rsquo;re still living it. If you claim to know perfectly well how to expand scope, manage priorities, collaborate with difficult teammates, and right all the wrongs, you&rsquo;re essentially saying &ldquo;everyone is drunk while I alone am sober&rdquo; (众人皆醉我独醒). That can&rsquo;t be true. You need repeated, honest conversations with friends and mentors to see where you can grow. Beyond that, you need to be that mentor and friend &mdash; support junior engineers &amp; peers and lead teams through difficult moments &mdash; to show leadership across the board. Just like internal promotions, getting a Senior+ offer often requires showing Staff-level qualities.</li>

<p>More companies now ask for 2–3 references from recent managers, teammates, or internal referrals. I remember this was already the case when I was interviewing for my first job in grad school &mdash; companies like Figma, Notion, Roblox, and Databricks have long required pre-offer reference checks. Nowadays, all frontier AI labs ask for them. So, it&rsquo;s important to be a kind and competent engineer while on a team and keep in touch with former colleagues and managers afterward.</p>
<p>Most companies have a team match stage. Back in 2024, I either received direct offers from hiring managers I met during onsites or a list of 5+ teams with openings. Finding a good fit was quick. This year, I don&rsquo;t know if it&rsquo;s due to leveling (&gt;= senior) or the market, most companies I interviewed with only had a couple of openings. If you just want to get matched to <em>a</em> team, the process can still move fast. But if you want to find a high-visibility, high-technical-complexity team that aligns well with your experience, you may need to wait for candidates ahead of you to turn down offers, or for another such team to open a headcount (this can take weeks). If there is a good team, dozens of candidates who have cleared the interview may want to speak with the hiring manager. Your years of experience, project complexity, and interview performance are evaluated all over again.</p>

</h4>
<p>As hard as it may sound, you gotta let go of the idea that <code>solving company tags == passing coding interviews</code> and actually get good at problem solving and coding up the solution you&rsquo;re thinking of.</p>
<p>LeetCode company tags came from candidates who encountered these problems in interviews. Some companies rarely update their question bank so their tags cover most of what you&rsquo;ll see in yours. However, you can&rsquo;t bank on that, since any company updates their questions occasionally. Moreover, companies like Google purposefully avoid asking leaked problems and you simply can&rsquo;t prepare for places like Apple or Netflix where each team writes their own questions.</p>
<p>So how do you get good at solving (most) random LC problems?</p>
<p>First thing first: don&rsquo;t theorize about solving LC problems until you&rsquo;ve solved enough of them. I always recommend taking the <a href="https://neetcode.io/courses/dsa-for-beginners/0">beginner</a> and <a href="https://neetcode.io/courses/advanced-algorithms/0">advanced</a> NeetCode courses first, and then practicing the <a href="https://neetcode.io/practice/practice">problems</a> curated by NeetCode. <a href="https://neetcode.io/practice/practice/neetcode250">NeetCode 250</a> strikes a good balance between quality and quantity. There&rsquo;s no shortcut &mdash; you either put in the hard work now and do what I mentioned, or did competitive programming as a kid; no other way to be great at LC. If you have time, I recommend participating in LC <a href="https://leetcode.com/contest/">Weekly Contest</a> to rehearse solving random Hard problems under time constraints (kinda necessary for Google).</p>
<p>Then, don&rsquo;t memorize concrete data structures you&rsquo;ve used for a specific problem &mdash; try figuring things out on the fly. After sufficient practice above, whenever I&rsquo;m given a new problem, I stare at the prompt and test cases for about 30 seconds, after which an intuition about the solution usually springs to mind. I then hastily jot down my fleeting thought on paper before it escapes me, then verbalize the solution step by step to the interviewer. My weakness is that if I don&rsquo;t get a flash of insight, I never get a &ldquo;strong yes&rdquo;. With prompting, I may stumble toward a solution and get a &ldquo;weak yes&rdquo;. In a tennis analogy, I&rsquo;m good at &ldquo;3-setters&rdquo; but fall short in &ldquo;5-set marathons&rdquo;. I guess some candidates may not have quick intuitions but are way better than me at taking hints, pivoting, and clutching out a solution after a long struggle. Maybe it&rsquo;s freeing to accept that we all have strengths and weaknesses and can solve some but not all arbitrary coding problems.</p>
<p>An example of &ldquo;figuring it out on the fly&rdquo;: if you&rsquo;re given some dependencies and asked to find a valid ordering that satisfies them, it&rsquo;s 99% a topological sort problem. At an abstract level, you need to construct an adjacency list and an indegree map for all nodes. That&rsquo;s all you have to remember from past solutions. You don&rsquo;t need to remember, for instance, that LC problems often provide dependencies as edge lists (weighted or unweighted, directed or bidirectional). A new problem may provide dependencies as links or pointers instead. Can you still recognize the problem? Maybe. Can you still construct the adjacency list and indegree map correctly? Maybe not. You might find yourself oscillating between trying to recall old solutions and reasoning about the current problem, only to write bugs and run out of time. The Reddit <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/leetcode/comments/1h886z6/most_frequent_google_interview_questions_on/">thread</a> below mirrors my preparation process:</p>
<figure><img src="https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/gr3tknplbn96loxapztvg/Screenshot-2026-01-31-at-12.16.10-AM.png?rlkey=ctun8ztfnb027wmxvrwgwvlhc&amp;st=i9pn9th5&amp;raw=1" width="800">
</figure>

<p>The implication: when practicing LC, focus on the problem <em>at hand</em>. Given the task (e.g., finding a valid order under dependency constraints), what&rsquo;s a good algorithm? Then use the input and starter code you&rsquo;re given <em>right here, right now</em> to implement that algorithm. Don&rsquo;t try to recall concrete bits from past solutions. If you do write a bug during practice, refrain from asking GPT or looking at the solution right away. Because in a real interview, now is the exact moment that makes or breaks this interview. If you&rsquo;re able to remain calm and debug &mdash; by printing suspicious parts or thinking from first principles &mdash; you send strong signals as a resourceful problem solver. If you panic or can&rsquo;t think of what to look into, it&rsquo;s a strong signal for rejection.</p>
<p>That said, don&rsquo;t practice randomly. For instance, while you don&rsquo;t need to (and probably never can) go over all Google tags, you can still research what types of problems are most popular at Google (e.g., <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/leetcode/comments/1izv4ln/how_to_actually_prepare_for_google_via_leetcode/">Reddit</a> says DP, graphs, and &ldquo;fancy string problems&rdquo;) and focus on those. Track which algorithms trip you up the most and practice accordingly. For me, it&rsquo;s definitely advanced graphs, linked lists and trees (I hate pointers), bottom-up DP, greedy, and string evaluation (e.g., Basic Calculator I, II, III). I also accept that as an ML engineer, there are so many other rounds that I can&rsquo;t be perfect at coding. If I run into a red-black tree problem, I just move on (&ldquo;人固有一死&rdquo; 😂).</p>

<p>I was reading Google&rsquo;s classic <a href="https://research.google/pubs/mapreduce-simplified-data-processing-on-large-clusters/">MapReduce</a> paper when it dawned on me that many &mdash; or dare I say, most? &mdash; LC problems stem from web-scale data processing. Google had massive amounts of web search event logs before it had MapReduce; engineers wrote custom scripts to answer questions like: what are the top k queries? how to build inverted indexes? how do we aggregate unbounded data streams?</p>
<p>Many LC problems answer these exact questions and tap into your ability and intuition to process loads of data efficiently. Examples:</p>
<ul>
<li>Streaming data &amp; online aggregation 👉 sliding window, two pointers, monotonic queues (e.g., <a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/sliding-window-maximum/description/">Sliding Window Maximum</a>, <a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-substring-without-repeating-characters/description/">Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters</a>)</li>
<li>Counting, frequency, and heavy hitters 👉 hash maps, heaps, bucket sort (e.g., <a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/top-k-frequent-elements/description/">Top K Frequent Elements</a>, <a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/majority-element/description/">Majority Element</a>)</li>
<li>Inverted indices &amp; lookup tables 👉 hash maps, tries (e.g., <a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/word-pattern/description/">Word Pattern</a>, <a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/implement-trie-prefix-tree/description/">Implement Trie</a>, <a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/design-search-autocomplete-system/description/">Design Search Autocomplete System</a>)</li>
<li>Event scanning and interval logic 👉 prefix sums, line sweep, sorting (e.g., <a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/meeting-rooms-ii/description/">Meeting Rooms II</a>, <a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/car-pooling/">Car Pooling</a>, <a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/the-skyline-problem/description/">The Skyline Problem</a>)</li>
<li>Scheduling and resource allocation 👉 greedy + heap (e.g., <a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/single-threaded-cpu/description/">Single-Threaded CPU</a>, <a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-profit-in-job-scheduling/description/">Maximum Profit in Job Scheduling</a>)</li>
<li>Data compaction and normalization 👉 union find, graph traversal (e.g., <a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/accounts-merge/description/">Accounts Merge</a>, Sentence Similarity <a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/sentence-similarity/description/">I</a> &amp; <a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/sentence-similarity-ii/description/">II</a>)</li>
</ul>
<p>Many complain that LC problems are detached from real work. But once I see them as toy versions of prod data processing and systems tasks, I solve LC problems faster, with more motivation and interest.</p>

 of passing object-oriented programming (OOP) interviews, where you need to build a toy version of a real-world system quickly. Example problems:</p>
<ul>
<li>Time-Based Key-Value Store</li>
<li>In-Memory Database</li>
<li>C-Like Memory Allocator</li>
<li>Type Inference Engine</li>
<li>Circuit Breaker</li>
<li>API Gateway with Rate Limiting</li>
<li>LRU / LFU Cache</li>
<li>Thread Pool / Task Scheduler</li>
<li>Transaction / Credit System</li>
<li>Employee Management System</li>
<li>&hellip;</li>
</ul>
<p>I used to think it&rsquo;s the <em>quickly</em> part that got me. Then, in a recent mock interview with a backend engineer, I came to see the real issue: my code passes test cases and looks clean, but my design choices are ridiculous for real-world backend systems &mdash; I make choices no good backend engineer would make. For example, when designing a cart, I chose to store price, units, and other attributes directly in an <code>Item</code> data class, whereas a backend engineer may use a unique <code>product_id</code> and link it to external metadata when needed. This is one of many decisions that I don&rsquo;t even realize I&rsquo;m getting wrong. The key point is that OOP interviews are as much about <em>system design</em> as they are about coding. Even if you finish all CodeSignal levels quickly, you can still fail due to poor design choices. Then, after you complete everything the prompt asks for, the interviewer often asks how you&rsquo;d optimize and scale this system in production. That&rsquo;s another place where non-backend engineers may fail a seemingly smooth interview.</p>
<p>To join companies such as OpenAI, Anthropic, Databricks, Netflix, Roblox, Notion, and Reddit, you have to pass OOP interviews with flying colors. Some folks obsess over collecting problems other candidates have seen in interviews, but that doesn&rsquo;t help if you make bad design decisions when solving these problems. If you can make good decisions, you don&rsquo;t need to see the problem beforehand.</p>
<p>Without domain knowledge, we make ridiculous choices. However, we probably don&rsquo;t have time to work as a backend engineer before an interview. We can still fill in the gap a bit before attempting problems blindly. After that enlightening mock interview, I was pointed to an awesome <a href="https://www.coditioning.com/app/learning/courses/tech_interview_prep/4">OOP crash course</a>. Go through it first. Then, ask GPT to reverse-engineer CodeSignal-style prompts for each common system:</p>

<p>Back in 2024, I interviewed with Quora. In a 90-minute coding round, you&rsquo;re given a realistic codebase (adapted from a real Python package repo) plus some unit tests, and you have to debug the codebase by reading error logs, identifying what&rsquo;s broken, and fixing them on your own, without AI. It was the hardest coding interview I&rsquo;ve passed.</p>
<p>Meta&rsquo;s AI-assisted coding is a tamed version of that. You get a much smaller toy codebase plus unit tests, and you&rsquo;re allowed to use an LLM to debug and complete the implementation. I interviewed with Meta in a hurry and only had time to play with the example question in the candidate portal. It may be the easiest coding interview I&rsquo;ve passed, because the problem could be smoothly solved on the spot:</p>
<ol>
<li>Read the instructions to understand the task and constraints.</li>
<li>Open and skim each file to learn what exists and how things are wired. No need to read them in detail, but note what&rsquo;s implemented vs. missing vs. commented to see what you must do.</li>
<li>Tell the interviewer your plan (e.g., re-read the instructions, fix unit tests, start with a naive implementation, then optimize).</li>
<li>Get unit tests passing. You can use AI to help, but you should be able to explain (a) why tests failed or were incomplete, and (b) why the changes better match the intended behavior.</li>
<li>Implement a naive solution first. The core problem you need to implement usually reduces to a LeetCode Medium problem; explain the algorithm, then use AI to write the code.</li>
<li>Measure performance. Define a performance metric and run simulations or benchmarks to evaluate the naive solution.</li>
<li>Optimize. Identify what&rsquo;s inefficient, propose a better algorithm, use AI to implement it, and evaluate the improved solution.</li>
</ol>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think my interviewer cared how much code was written by AI vs. me. They cared more about how well I partnered with AI to achieve the goal. I didn&rsquo;t write much code myself, but I designed the algorithm, broke down the task, and prompted the AI to complete each subtask &mdash; similar to how I work day to day. Signals that may matter:</p>
<ul>
<li>Communicate clear plans to the interviewer and prompt the AI effectively (tight prompts, explicit constraints, incremental diffs).</li>
<li>Read error messages carefully and iterate accordingly.</li>
<li>Explain what the AI is doing and why you accept or reject a suggested change. Don&rsquo;t copy &amp; paste with no explanations.</li>
<li>Stay in control: you set the plan, and the AI accelerates execution.</li>

<p>Okay, so ML coding will be right in our alley, right? That&rsquo;d be the funniest thing I&rsquo;ve heard 🤣🤣🤣. I like OOP 10x more over ML coding.</p>
<p>If I ask my ML engineer friends and colleagues, 9 out of 10 will say they love machine learning, but it will scare the hell out of all to write PyTorch code without inheriting from a family heirloom model class or using Cursor. In ML coding interviews, however, you&rsquo;re expected to write PyTorch as fluently as regular Python. Even if you can Google, you&rsquo;re bound to run out of time if you need to Google much.</p>
<p>So how to be well-prepared for ML coding? I wish I knew but doubt if anyone does &mdash; for instance, I bet if you take away the rubrics from your interviewer, they can&rsquo;t code up the solution to their own question without physical pain. So I&rsquo;ll venture my best guesses below.</p>
<p>The obvious thing is to get fluent in PyTorch. For starters, read <a href="https://sebastianraschka.com/teaching/pytorch-1h/">PyTorch in One Hour</a> and play with <a href="https://tensorgym.com/">TensorGym</a>. For a more comprehensive tutorial, go over <a href="https://www.learnpytorch.io/">Zero to Mastery Learn PyTorch for Deep Learning</a>.</p>
<p>The non-obvious thing is how to cover all ML concepts you might be asked to code up. I&rsquo;ll offer 3 ideas (they may not be good ideas).</p>
<p>The first idea is to implement common model architectures from scratch, such as Transformers (encoder, decoder, encoder–decoder), MLP, CNN, RNN (GRU, LSTM), or &ldquo;traditional models&rdquo; like logistic regression, linear regression, KNN, K-Means, decision trees, and so on. Instead of importing modules from <code>torch.nn</code>, implement the building blocks yourself: embedding lookups, projection and linear layers, layer norm, batch norm, attention (causal and bidirectional), residual connections, dropout, activations, you name it. This way, you learn not only the &ldquo;primitives&rdquo; of deep learning, but also how they&rsquo;re wired together. Below is an example of a vanilla Transformer decoder.</p>

<p>To get comfortable with Transformer architectures as well as training and inference loops, read <a href="https://github.com/rasbt/LLMs-from-scratch">Build a Large Language Model</a> and reproduce the code on your own. Watch Andrej Karpathy&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCc8FmEb1nY">GPT-2 video</a>. If you have extra time, follow along with Karpathy&rsquo;s <a href="https://karpathy.ai/zero-to-hero.html">Neural Networks: Zero to Hero</a> and read some of his repos (e.g., <a href="https://github.com/karpathy/nanoGPT">nanoGPT</a>, <a href="https://github.com/karpathy/micrograd">micrograd</a>). You should also be familiar with common training and inference optimizations, such as <a href="https://lubits.ch/flash/">Flash Attention</a>, <a href="https://lightning.ai/lightning-ai/environments/code-lora-from-scratch?section=featured">LoRA</a>, beam search, <a href="https://huggingface.co/blog/kv-cache">KV cache</a>), etc., and know how to implement them from scratch.</p>
<p>The problem is: what if the interviewer asks about something other than architectures? For example, how to implement autograd from scratch instead of calling <code>loss.backward()</code>? Or, given scores and labels from a binary classifier, how to compute ranking metrics?</p>
<p>To maximize Recall, here&rsquo;s a second idea: practice ML coding the same way you practice LC. A great website is <a href="https://www.deep-ml.com/problems">Deep-ML</a> &mdash; it&rsquo;s like LC, but for ML. You can practice individual problems or work through collections.</p>
<p>If you prefer theory before code, a third idea is to read <a href="https://udlbook.github.io/udlbook/">Understanding Deep Learning</a> and study the accompanying <a href="https://udlbook.github.io/udlbook/">notebooks</a>. I don&rsquo;t think you need extra preparation for ML fundamentals after this.</p>
<p>Last but not least, not all companies ask you to write PyTorch models. Some ask you to fit classical Scikit-learn models or use NumPy to implement from scratch. Don&rsquo;t be caught off the guard &mdash; brush up with Educative&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.educative.io/blog/scikit-learn-cheat-sheet-classification-regression-methods">Scikit-learn cheat sheet</a>. To practice NumPy itself, go over the <a href="https://github.com/rougier/numpy-100">numpy-100</a> repo and the <a href="https://www.labri.fr/perso/nrougier/from-python-to-numpy/"><em>From Python to Numpy</em></a> tutorial.</p>

<p>I find it deeply unsatisfying to collect a checklist of “common questions” and prepare only for those. For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>What are common optimizers?</li>
<li>What are common activation functions?</li>
<li>What are common loss functions?</li>
<li>What are common learning rate schedules?</li>
<li>What to do if the loss doesn&rsquo;t converge?</li>
<li>What is overfitting? How to prevent it?</li>
<li>What are vanishing/exploding gradients? How to prevent them?</li>
<li>What is a Transformer? How do encoders and decoders differ?</li>
<li>Why do we use softmax activation of multiclass classification? What does the temperature parameter do?</li>
<li>… and so on.</li>
</ul>
<p>My philosophy is, every minute I spend on interview prep should make me a better engineer. After all, I&rsquo;m not a professional interviewee; I&rsquo;m a professional ML engineer. Memorizing answers doesn&rsquo;t do that for me. I treat ML fundamental prep as an opportunity to revisit deep learning foundations and uncover knowledge gaps I didn&rsquo;t know I had.</p>
<p>As mentioned in the ML coding section, a good way to prepare is to read the <a href="https://udlbook.github.io/udlbook/"><em>Understanding Deep Learning</em></a> book and check out the notebooks. If you&rsquo;re short on time, read Chapters 1–9, 11, and 12.</p>
<p>While I like Kevin Murphy&rsquo;s <a href="https://probml.github.io/pml-book/">PML books</a>, the clever bits are scattered across chapters. I&rsquo;ve had many epiphanies reading his writing, but it&rsquo;s not always phrased in the &ldquo;standard language&rdquo; you or your interviewers instinctively think in. They may not be good prep books.</p>

 generated by the following combinations:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Feed (organic + ads)</strong>: Can you design XXX recommendations? 👉 choose from <code>{content, people, product}</code>
<ul>
<li>Content could be long videos (think YouTube), short videos (TikTok), posts (LinkedIn), music (Spotify), restaurants (Uber Eats), places (Google Maps), ads (CTR, CVR), notifications, promotions, query suggestions, to name a few</li>
<li>People could be people you may know (think LinkedIn or Facebook), artists (Spotify), colleagues (Glean), etc.</li>
<li>Product could be anything sold by the platform or sellers</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Search</strong>: Can you design XXX search? 👉 choose from <code>{consumer vs. enterprise}</code> × <code>{open-domain vs. closed-domain}</code> × <code>{conversational vs. one-off}</code>
<ul>
<li>Feed vs. search: Many think the two are alike but their origins and goals are quite different 👉 feed makes educated guesses about what users might like, whereas search is <em>question answering</em> &mdash; the system is strictly required to retrieve <em>relevant</em> documents to satisfy the user&rsquo;s <em>information need</em>.</li>
<li>Who&rsquo;s asking: Consumer search (e.g., Google, Perplexity, Amazon) handles huge amounts of traffic, whereas enterprise search (e.g., Glean) has to be extra permission-aware</li>
<li>Asking about what: Web search allows you to search anything (e.g., Google, Perplexity, ChatGPT), whereas e-commerce (e.g., Amazon, DoorDash, Uber Eats) or other specialty websites (e.g., Airbnb, LinkedIn) typically only allow you to search products or entities that exist on that platform</li>
<li>How to get answers: Traditional search engines returns a list of ranked documents &mdash; if you&rsquo;re not happy, you have to reformulate your query (e.g., typos? too vague? too specific?) and search again; conversational search allows you to have back-and-forth chats with the system to clarify your intent or ask follow-up questions and get a good answer in a few turns</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Other common topics</strong>: Trust and safety (e.g., harmful content detection), <code>{user, content, query}</code> understanding, etc.
<ul>
<li><code>{user, content, query}</code> understanding: Usually some sort of deep representation learning model trained with some sort of contrastive objectives (see Lilian Weng&rsquo;s amazing <a href="https://lilianweng.github.io/posts/2021-05-31-contrastive/">post</a>) to embed single entities or entity pairs/triads/etc. 👉 from a system perspective, the interesting parts are how to do distributed training (especially if you&rsquo;re fine-tuning an LLM too large to to fit in worker memory), how to index trained embeddings with low storage costs without metric loss, how to version and roll back embeddings, etc. (see <a href="https://www.uber.com/blog/evolution-and-scale-of-ubers-delivery-search-platform/">Uber post</a>)</li>
<li>Harmful content detection: Usually some sort of multimodal, multi-task, multi-label classification model trained on a combination of <code>{user, annotator, LLM}</code>-generated labels to predict the probability of each type of harm, based on which we can take automatic or human-reviewed actions</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Below is how I usually approach ML model design problems:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Problem framing</strong>: understand what to build and how
<ul>
<li><strong>Clarify what system to build</strong>: What&rsquo;s the UI and the model entry point? How do users engage with recommendations? How do you want them to engage? What&rsquo;s the scale to build for (e.g., corpus size, avg + peak QPS, latency budget)?
<ul>
<li>I never have a fixed list of questions. I just close my eyes for a second and let my intuitions speak about what&rsquo;s important for this system that could also impact the design. I sometimes play with the team or the company&rsquo;s product and imagine how I&rsquo;d build it as a PM/EM/MLE.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Understand why build it (business objectives)</strong>: What are the desired actions you want your users to take immediately? What long term benefits do you want to bring to all parties in the system (e.g., users, the platform, and perhaps creators, advertisers, sellers, etc.)? What don&rsquo;t you wanna see? These tell us the {short-term vs. long-term, positive vs. negative} metrics you can use to measure the success of your system.</li>
<li><strong>Propose how to build it with ML (ML objectives)</strong>: If you predict one outcome, what would it be? If you build a multi-task model to predict multiple outcomes, what are they?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>High-level design</strong>: lay out key components in your system

    </figure>

<ul>
<li><strong>Online path</strong>: request (e.g., <code>POST /v1/feed:fetch</code>) 👉 API gateway (load balancing, authentication, rate limiting) 👉 retrieval 👉 L1 ranking 👉 L2 ranking 👉 logging &amp; monitoring</li>
<li><strong>Offline path</strong>: feature engineering (lambda architecture: batch + streaming processing), training data generation, model training, indexing (ANN, inverted index, forward index)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Step-by-step design</strong>: flesh out ML details in each component
<ul>
<li><strong>Retrieval</strong>: billions 👉 thousands; optimize Recall
<ul>
<li><strong>Model-based</strong>: e.g., embedding-based retrieval (user-to-item, item-to-item, user-to-user), semantic ID match</li>
<li><strong>Heuristic-based</strong>: e.g., popular/trending (time-decayed counts), content from people/topics you follow, etc.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>L1 ranking</strong>: thousands 👉 hundreds; also optimize Recall
<ul>
<li><strong>Objective</strong>: select items that will likely end up in L2 top k</li>
<li><strong>Training data</strong>: impression data (L2 results returned to users + user engagement labels) + early funnel logs (L1 results + synthetic labels from an LLM or an L2 teacher; logs are sampled to keep storage cost reasonable)</li>
<li><strong>Features</strong>: in theory, we can use all L2 features, including request features (user + context), item features, and cross features; in practice, select essential features and avoid high-cardinality cross features to reduce latency</li>
<li><strong>Model architectures</strong>: e.g., GBDT, two-tower (no feature interaction), simple DNN (e.g., fully connected)</li>
<li><strong>Objectives</strong>: depends on the architecture 👉 e.g., if training two-tower, can use contrastive loss (if we use negative sampling) or just binary cross entropy (predict for each actual example); if training a simple DNN with an L2 teacher, use binary cross entropy + distillation loss</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>L2 ranking</strong>: hundreds 👉 dozens; optimize ranking metrics
<ul>
<li><strong>Objective</strong>: predict <code>pAction</code> and rank items by it; alternatively, prediction multiple <code>pAction</code> and rank by the core <code>pAction</code> or a weight sum (I never say this because I don&rsquo;t know how to do tune weights <em>properly</em> and I really, really don&rsquo;t like building <a href="https://engineering.fb.com/2023/08/09/ml-applications/scaling-instagram-explore-recommendations-system/">Value Models</a>)</li>
<li><strong>Training data</strong>: impression data (L2 engagements)</li>
<li><strong>Features</strong>: now we can use a rich set of request features (user + context), item features, and cross features; many companies also include expensive but effective features such as user engagement history for sequence models</li>
<li><strong>Model architectures</strong>: while Generative Recommendation is being hyped everywhere (and I <a href="/posts/generative_recommendation/" class="backlink">wrote</a>
  
   about it with great curiosities), most companies still use DLRM-style models with feature processing (normalize numeric features and pass them through an MLP; look up embedding features and project them to desired dimensions; pass sequence features to a Transformer module 👉 concatenate outputs), feature interaction (use MLP/CNN/RNN, attention, explicit cross networks, or throw a kitchen sink at the problem like <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.11014">DHEN</a>), and feature transformation layers (e.g., expert sub-networks each process features in its own way and gating networks leverage expert outputs for each task).</li>
<li><strong>Objectives</strong>: most modern L2 ranking models predict multiple <code>pAction</code> that matter to the system; for each prediction, we can use pointwise loss, pairwise loss, or listwise loss for training 👉 for ads ranking, pointwise loss is most common since it&rsquo;s easy to calibrate; search often uses pairwise or listwise loss to optimize for order.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Deep dives</strong>: discuss glossed-over key details, such as scaling the system (e.g., vertical/horizontal scaling, sharding, caching, replication + load balancing), handling positional bias, cold start, data drifts, and so on. Usually the interviewer will prompt you.</li>
</ol>
<p>Above is just a skeleton. I find ML model design interview outcomes to be highly dependent on the interviewer. If the interviewer doesn&rsquo;t work on RecSys or is inexperienced, the experience can be excruciating &mdash; the interviewer may over-index on structure and question your choices or explanations when they come from actual practices that the interviewer isn&rsquo;t familiar with. An experienced interviewer, by contrast, will let you skip unimportant parts and dive into the interesting components, asking how you handle tricky situations in day-to-day work or how the industry typically approaches them. Those conversations are lovely. I&rsquo;ve only run into the former type once or twice; in those cases, I know I won&rsquo;t join the team.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re short on time, below is an essential list of papers to read:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>DLRM vs. Generative Recommendation paradigms</strong>: <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17152"><em>Actions Speak Louder than Words</em></a> 👉 like HSTU or not, this is the best paper to understand the general components in any deep learning recommendation models (DLRM) and how they differ from language models or so-called &ldquo;generative recommenders&rdquo; (GR). I also wrote a <a href="/posts/generative_recommendation/" class="backlink">blogpost</a>
  
   on this topic. Feel free to check it out.</li>
<li><strong>Feature extractions</strong>: Maybe it&rsquo;s because of what I wrote on my resume, I find most of my interviewers were not super interested in how &ldquo;normal&rdquo; features are processed (e.g., normalizing numeric features and passing outputs to an MLP, looking up embeddings for categorical or ID features and projecting outputs, looking up and them pooling embeddings for an array of categorical or ID features), but instead rushed me through those features so I could elaborate on how user sequences are processed by a Transformer encoder or decoder. See my <a href="/posts/seq_user_modeling/" class="backlink">blogpost</a>
  
   on sequence modeling.</li>
<li><strong>Feature interactions</strong>: When DLRM first got traction in RecSys, feature interactions were the major selling point &mdash; while we may need to hand-engineer restricted-order feature crossing for &ldquo;traditional models&rdquo; (e.g., logistic regression), we can let deep learning models automatically learn higher-order feature interactions, either in a bit-wise (each feature dimension is an interaction unit) or a field-wise (each embedding is an interaction unit) fashion. Meta researchers found different interaction mechanisms capture different information and proposed <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.11014">DHEN</a>, which throws a kitchen sink at the feature interaction problem. Read this paper and cited papers to learn different interaction methods (e.g., MLP: <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1606.07792">Deep &amp; Wide</a>; explicit cross networks: <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1708.05123">DCN</a>, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.13535">DCNv2</a>; factorization machines: <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.04247">DeepFM</a>, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.05170">xDeepFM</a>, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02545">Wukong</a>; attention: <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.11921">AutoInt</a>, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.07619">MaskNet</a>). <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15551">RankMixer</a> and <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26104">OneTrans</a> are influential new papers on this topic in larger-scale RecSys.</li>
<li><strong>Feature transformations</strong>: Another selling point of DLRM is its ability to leverage shared feature representations to predict different tasks, such as clicks, conversions, watch time, and other engagement outcomes one cares about. Read the seminal <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.09580">MMoE</a> paper and its predecessor <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3383313.3412236">PLE</a> on such multi-task learning.</li>
<li><strong>Practical concerns</strong>: For most RecSys MLEs, unless you work on these problems, you&rsquo;re definitely aware of their existence but may not speak intelligently about solutions &mdash; such as cold start (recommend new items or recommend for new users), positional bias (learn inherent item relevance, debiasing the influence from item positions), diversity (dedupe &amp; re-rank results by topic, creator, or other criteria), or value models (if ranking by multiple objectives, find the &ldquo;best&rdquo; weight of each). Read one or two paper on each topic (e.g., cold start: Kuaishou <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3640457.3688098">1</a> &amp; <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3701716.3715205">2</a>; positional bias: <a href="https://research.google/pubs/position-bias-estimation-for-unbiased-learning-to-rank-in-personal-search/">Google</a>; diversity: <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.05020">Kuaishou</a>; value models: <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05292">Pinterest</a>), so you can say while you&rsquo;re not an expert, you know some solutions.</li>
</ol>
<p>When preparing for design interviews, I pick a handful of common problems (e.g., short video recommendations, place recommendations, friend recommendations, CTR/CVR ads ranking, harmful content detection, retrieval-augmented generation) and write full designs for each. I start by sketching the high-level system from first principles, then read industry blogs, papers, and my company&rsquo;s practices to fill in the details. Once everything is on paper, I practice delivery under time constraints (typically 45 minutes to 1 hour) and move extra material into &ldquo;deep dives&rdquo;. Sometimes I spend 3+ days on a single design and end up with a 40+ page document. In reality, no interviewer goes into that much detail. For a ranking design, for example, covering the standard multi-stage ranking funnel and adding one or two interesting insights from work or papers is 100% enough for a &ldquo;strong yes&rdquo;.</p>

<p>I have colleagues who are both strong ML engineers and ML infra engineers. They have one thing in common: 15+ years of experience, having started as backend/infra engineers before ML was cool, and then growing into ML leaders. Most of my peers and I, however, started our careers as baby ML engineers trying only to move model metrics, without deep low-level ML infra knowledge. Most of the time, you can avoid ML infra interviews &mdash; but a handful of places (e.g., DoorDash, Reddit, Netflix, Snap) specifically ask MLE candidates to design the <em>infra</em> behind ML systems. It&rsquo;s funny that I&rsquo;ve interviewed with them all and somehow never managed to escape this round.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve summarized my ML infra interview preparation in this <a href="/posts/ml_infra_interviews/" class="backlink">blogpost</a>
  
  . It&rsquo;s pretty long, so I won&rsquo;t repeat its content here in the interest of space. Do check it out! Below are key lessons I&rsquo;ve learned:</p>
<ol>
<li>The best way to understand ML infra is to start from the infra teams you collaborate with and learn what they do (e.g., via design docs, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Distributed-Machine-Learning-Patterns-Yuan/dp/1617299022">books</a>, and engineering blogs; see <a href="https://www.yuan-meng.com/posts/ml_infra_interviews/#references">resources</a>)
<ul>
<li><strong>Data infra</strong>: e.g., how features are defined, computed, stored, and updated (batch vs. streaming); how engagement events are logged; how training data (features + labels) is generated via forward logging or backfill.</li>
<li><strong>Training infra</strong>: e.g., how training is distributed across GPUs; checkpointing; failure recovery; continuous retraining + validation; model publishing and rollout/rollback.</li>
<li><strong>Serving infra</strong>: e.g., how to fetch request (user + context) vs. document vs. cross features; when and how to batch requests; reducing end-to-end latency (caching, sharding, load balancing); real-time feature updates; pagination for large responses; engagement event logging.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Brush up on distributed system knowledge, but don&rsquo;t dwell on it. ML infra is a special case of distributed systems, but you usually don&rsquo;t need to go deep on things like rate limiters or post creation/updates. The focus is the infra around <strong>ML</strong>.
<ul>
<li><strong>NeetCode</strong>: watch <a href="https://neetcode.io/courses/system-design-for-beginners/0">System Design for Beginners</a> and checkout sections in <a href="https://neetcode.io/courses/system-design-interview/9">System Design Interview</a> relevant to ML systems, such as KV stores and distributed message queues.</li>
<li><strong>Hello Interview</strong>: go through <a href="https://www.hellointerview.com/learn/system-design/in-a-hurry/introduction">System Design in a Hurry</a> as well as core concepts, patterns, key technologies, and advanced topics like time-series databases (think feature stores).</li>
<li><a href="https://dataintensive.net/"><strong>DDIA book</strong></a>: skim Chapters 1-11 if you have time.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>To practice, design feature stores, training data generation, distributed training, and retrieval &amp; ranking (organic + ads), etc.. Spend 2–3 days per design to think through all details. Below is the table of contents in a toy ads ranking system design I wrote.

<p>Then it boils down to how you pick and tell your stories. While companies ask the same questions, they value different qualities in an engineer. For instance, moving fast and breaking things (e.g., incurring a tech to meet a short-term goal) may be a vice at Google, which values doing things &ldquo;the right way&rdquo;, it&rsquo;s a virtue at companies like DoorDash or startups where scrappiness is the key to survival (your own and that of your company). Friends have told me that studying Amazon&rsquo;s leadership principles is the best way to prepare for behavior interviews, even if you don&rsquo;t interview with Amazon. But for me personally, I&rsquo;m more at ease with the <a href="https://jeffhsipe.medium.com/understanding-googelyness-4d61a70ada95">Googlyness</a> interview: instead of being grilled on reciting stories that map to rigid qualities, you&rsquo;re valued for being emotionally intelligent, ethical, kind, and curious.</p>
<p>To quickly prepare for each question, I usually start with a rough story &mdash; just a few sentences I hastily jot down about an experience I&rsquo;m proud of or learned from, throw in the company values, and prompt GPT to turn it into a SAIL (situation, action, impact, learning) story.</p>

<p>In phone screens, hiring manager chats, or design interviews, you may be asked to walk through a project you&rsquo;re most proud of. Some companies have a dedicated 45-minute or 1-hour round for project deep dives. If slides are allowed, 10–12 is a good amount.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no skill for this round. If you&rsquo;ve led a project with great technical challenges (e.g., SOTA models, label scarcity, serving challenges) or cross-functional complexity (e.g., many stakeholders with divided opinions, hard trade-offs), this is your chance to shine. I find this round to be the deciding factor for hiring decisions. Coding interviews weed out weak candidates, but exactly no one gets hired because they did well on coding. Design interviews test your first-principles thinking, but you might never have had success in this domain yet. Project deep dives, by contrast, show exactly why you&rsquo;re the right person for this team &mdash; e.g., because you bring the exact technical expertise the team needs and your leadership and decision-making style gets things done on this team or in this organization.</p>
<p>To prepare, I take a piece of paper and walk down the memory lane to detail everything that happened in the project. I then organize those pieces by collaboration complexity, ambiguity, and technical complexity, and tell my story in chapters: design, development, launch, learnings, and next steps. Check out my <a href="https://www.yuan-meng.com/notes/project_complexity/">post</a> for more details.</p>

<p>When considering where to interview, I look for a combination of <code>top pay + modern ML stacks + interesting work + willingness to hire me at a senior-or-above level</code>. I applied to OpenAI, Roblox, Databricks, and Notion; other interviews came from recruiter outreach. I didn&rsquo;t ask for referrals before applying because they are time-consuming and rarely help &mdash; if your profile is strong, recruiters will proceed anyway; if your profile doesn&rsquo;t fit the role, a referral will lead to a review and a rejection, only faster.</p>
<p>Below are roles I interviewed for, grouped by domain. I specified the team in parentheses for team-based hires. I&rsquo;ve highlighted top-paying senior+ roles in case you have similar goals (<span style="background-color: #B3E59A">550–649k</span>; <span style="background-color: #FDB515">650–800+k</span>).</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>RecSys</strong>: <span style="background-color: #FDB515">Snap ML Engineer</span>, <span style="background-color: #FDB515">Meta ML Engineer (Ads)</span>, <span style="background-color: #FDB515">xAI Member of the Technical Staff</span>, <span style="background-color: #B3E59A">Netflix ML Engineer (Ads)</span>, <span style="background-color: #B3E59A">Roblox ML Engineer (Ads)</span>, Google ML SWE, Apple ML Engineer (Search), Notion SWE (Search), Unity ML Engineer (Ads), Shopify AI Engineer (Recommendation), Uber ML Engineer (Search)</li>
<li><strong>Applied AI</strong> (e.g., RAG, agents, chatbots, embedding models): <span style="background-color: #FDB515">OpenAI Research Engineer</span>, <span style="background-color: #FDB515">DeepMind Applied AI Engineer</span>, <span style="background-color: #FDB515">Databricks AI Engineer</span>, Nvidia ML Engineer, Perplexity AI Engineer, Anysphere (Cursor&rsquo;s company) Research Engineer</li>
</ul>
<p>Of course, research roles at frontier labs pay much more, but getting a job isn&rsquo;t about how you want to get paid, but what you bring to the table. Outside research roles, the <span style="background-color: #FDB515">highlighted</span> ones above are perhaps the most RecSys ML engineers can make using the skills we have.</p>
<p>In the weeks leading up to my resignation from DoorDash, my manager, skip, several leaders, and a few XFN partners tried to convince me to stay. They didn&rsquo;t understand why I wanted to leave only because I wanted to work on more SOTA models, when both the DoorDash business and myself were doing well. To summarize their arguments: (1) DoorDash has strong business fundamentals, which translates into plenty of scope and fast promotions; (2) for ML engineers, model complexity doesn&rsquo;t matter as much as scope and impact, and many strong companies still rely on tree-based models; and (3) if I cared about SOTA models, I could read papers on my own.</p>
<p>(1) is true. DoorDash&rsquo;s business is doing well, promotions are fast, and individual MLE scope can be super broad. Moreover, thanks to stock appreciation, those who joined in 2022 get paid far above the market. (2) and (3), however, couldn&rsquo;t be more wrong. For ML engineers, model complexity absolutely matters &mdash; not on its own, but because of the people it attracts. Working alongside world-class ML practitioners and researchers allows you to witness great minds in action: how they debug, innovate, make trade-offs, and bring challenging models to a launch. You can never read about such experiences in papers. After a few years, these folks tend to move on to more frontier places and may recruit you if you&rsquo;ve been a solid MLE. In another few years, you move with them to even more frontier places. Perhaps this is how we build the momentum to continuously move upward in the industry.</p>
<p>When I joined Pinterest in 2024, I knew it wouldn&rsquo;t be a long stint, but it was a necessary one given where I was. I already had large scope and impact from my time at DoorDash; what I lacked was hands-on experience with SOTA models. Without the latter, I knew it&rsquo;d be impossible to get senior+ offers from top payers. Piecing together the two opposing experiences, I could build a brand of being able to both move fast and dive deep, which is a rare quality to hire for. Of course, companies are too coarse a unit to evaluate a career move &mdash; what attracted me to Pinterest was the invite to join a strong ranking team and work on sequence models. Upon hindsight, my reasoning paid off.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t need to make the same choices I did (I like to design both life and work intentionally 🤣), but it&rsquo;s worth thinking about which &ldquo;pieces&rdquo; you need to collect to build a fulfilling and rewarding career.</p>

<p>When friends ask me how to prepare for interviews, I always ask: <em>&ldquo;Which companies are you interviewing with?&rdquo;</em> I only start preparing after having several phone screens lined up, since different companies have different interview loops &mdash; I  don&rsquo;t know how to start before recruiters explain what the interview rounds are and what each round entails.</p>
<p>They inevitably ask: <em>&ldquo;But isn&rsquo;t it too late? How do I have time to prepare after interviews are scheduled?&rdquo;</em> That&rsquo;s an interesting question, since you control when you start interviewing after the recruiter call. Sure, if you start late, a company may run out of headcount. But if a company isn&rsquo;t hiring for at least 2–3 months, why would you want to join them?</p>
<p>Different companies test very different things. If you interview with OpenAI, you&rsquo;ll see lots of OOP problems, followed by a non-standard behavioral round and a project presentation. Google&rsquo;s coding interviews ask random Hard LC questions &mdash; lots of graph, string, and DP problems. By contrast, Meta&rsquo;s coding interviews don&rsquo;t ask especially challenging questions, but you have to be really fast at solving classic problems; their behavioral and design rounds are also fairly standard, but you usually need a &ldquo;yes&rdquo; in every round to get an offer. Snap&rsquo;s interviews are difficult and unique &mdash; the coding problems are hard to wrap your head around, and the ML infra design round scares most ML engineers to death. So ask your recruiters what the rounds are and what the passing criteria look like, come back to this blog post to review tips for each round, and prepare for the interviews you actually have, rather than preparing in some abstract, generic way. Below is the minimal, essential prep for each interview round:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Coding</p>
<ul>
<li>LeetCode: finish <a href="https://neetcode.io/practice/practice/neetcode250">NeetCode 250</a>, then practice company tags, focusing on problem solving rather than memorization</li>
<li>OOP: go over the <a href="https://www.coditioning.com/app/learning/courses/tech_interview_prep/4">OOP course</a> and practice <a href="https://www.yuan-meng.com/posts/mle_interviews_2.0/#2-objective-oriented-programming">problems</a></li>
<li>ML coding: refresh PyTorch/NumPy syntax and pick one of the <a href="https://www.yuan-meng.com/posts/mle_interviews_2.0/#4-ml-coding">3 approaches</a> to practice ML implementations</li>
<li>AI-assisted coding: practice the problem in the candidate portal and think about how you&rsquo;d approach the problem later</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Design</p>
<ul>
<li>ML model design: revisit classic RecSys papers and practice designing common ML systems summarized <a href="http://localhost:1313/posts/mle_interviews_2.0/#6-ml-model-design">here</a></li>
<li>ML infra design: read my ML infra design <a href="https://www.yuan-meng.com/posts/ml_infra_interviews/">post</a> and practice designing above systems, but with an infra focus</li>
<li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Designing-Data-Intensive-Applications-Reliable-Maintainable/dp/1449373321">DDIA</a>-style backend system design: I&rsquo;d probably give up here &mdash; this role likely doesn&rsquo;t match our backgrounds</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>ML fundamentals</p>
<ul>
<li>Read the <a href="https://udlbook.github.io/udlbook/">UDL book</a> and answer <a href="https://www.yuan-meng.com/posts/mle_interviews_2.0/#5-ml-fundamentals">common questions</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Behavioral</p>
<ul>
<li>Read my <a href="https://www.yuan-meng.com/notes/project_complexity/">post</a> and review your most complex project</li>
<li>Review your career story (by yourself and with a trusted mentor) and prep answers to <a href="https://www.yuan-meng.com/posts/mle_interviews_2.0/#8-behavior-interview">these questions</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Two years ago, I over-prepared for each company. I was exhausted and didn&rsquo;t have many competing offers. This year, I was rushed through interviews &mdash; either because teams wanted to close quickly or didn&rsquo;t want me to hit an offer deadline elsewhere. In two cases toward the end of my interview cycle, I only had 3–5 days to finish the entire interview loop, so I only had time to design one or two ML systems the team likely built and practice a couple dozen company tags.</p>
<p>I still passed, because while different companies have different rounds, problem-solving instincts do generalize (I&rsquo;d already done several full loops before then). If you have the right experience for the hiring team, just try your best to show that. If you don&rsquo;t, no amount of preparation will compensate for a lack of fit, especially at higher levels.</p>

<p>Like I <a href="https://www.yuan-meng.com/posts/mle_interviews_2.0/#6-ml-model-design">mentioned</a>, I picked a few problems to flesh out when preparing for ML model/infra designs. See 3 examples below. Please ignore my hastily written bits and take what you need from the raw designs.</p>
