<p>What makes Generative Recommendation so magical? Why is it able to unlock the scaling laws in recommender systems in ways that DLRM wasn&rsquo;t able to? Is GM a genuine paradigm shift or a short-lived fad? In this blogpost, let&rsquo;s take a look at GM models coming out from the aforementioned companies and see what the fuss is all about 🕵️.</p>

<p>If in the old days sciences had a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physics_envy">&ldquo;physics envy&rdquo;</a>, then today&rsquo;s machine learning definitely has an &ldquo;LLM envy&rdquo;. By duplicating a deceptively simple architecture &mdash; the Transformer (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762">Vaswani et al., 2017</a>) &mdash; many times over and training models on massive amounts of data, large language models seem to have unlocked <span class="sidenote">

intelligence. Other AI/ML domains are eager to replicate this success, especially recommender systems, which remain the lifeline of the tech industry.</p>
<p>Why not? After all, there are many similarities between recommender systems and the NLP domain, as noted by Meta researchers in <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.15333"><em>Breaking the Curse of Quality Saturation with User-Centric Ranking</em></a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The key idea, with an analogy to NLP, is to think of items as tokens and users as documents, i.e., each user is modeled by a list of items that they engaged with, in chronological order according to the time of engagements.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A user is thus a &ldquo;book&rdquo; written by a history of engaged items, and web-scale recommender systems provide endless training data. In language models, performance predictably improves with model size or training data (e.g., linear or power-law relationships), a phenomenon called &ldquo;scaling laws&rdquo; (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.15556">Hoffmann et al., 2022</a>). In DLRM recommender systems, however, scaling laws have never emerged. In recommenders employing Transformer modules, increasing the number of Transformer layers doesn&rsquo;t improve performance &mdash; more often than not, one layer is all you need (e.g., Chen et al., <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3326937.3341261">KDD 19</a>, Gu et al., CIKM <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3340531.3412697">20</a>, <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3459637.3481953">21</a>). Regardless of the architecture, training DLRM recommenders for more than one epoch typically results in rapid performance deterioration (the &ldquo;one-epoch phenomenon&rdquo;; Zhang et al., <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3511808.3557479">CIKM 22</a>).</p>
<p>So how do we explain this stark contrast between language and recommendation models? Back in 2021, Netflix published a &ldquo;popular science&rdquo; paper that foresaw the challenges of DLRM-style recommenders. In this paper, <a href="https://ojs.aaai.org/aimagazine/index.php/aimagazine/article/view/18140">Steck et al. (2021)</a> argued that deep learning recommender systems differ  from other deep learning applications such as image classification in that item IDs are &ldquo;atomic&rdquo; and directly available in the data &mdash; there are no low-to-high level feature representations to extract (e.g., pixels to objects in images). As such, deep learning recommenders only require a shallow network to learn user and item embeddings from user-item interactions, effectively learning &ldquo;dot product&rdquo; operations. They don&rsquo;t benefit from deeper architectures meant to capture low-level features.</p>
<p>This observation is profound, highlighting inherent flaws in DLRM:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Lack of task complexity</strong>: Why do we need the full power of deep learning to learn a task as simple as performing dot products? If shallow networks are enough, how could scaling laws emerge?</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>[&hellip;] a syntactically complex phrase is a function of the meanings of its constituent parts and the way they are combined. &mdash; <a href="https://oecs.mit.edu/pub/e222wyjy/release/1"><em>Compositionality</em></a>, Ryan M. Nefdt and Christopher Potts</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>No compositionality, no intelligence</strong>: Imagine if each word as an arbitrary sound unrelated to others &mdash; e.g., saying &ldquo;blim&rdquo; for &ldquo;snake&rdquo; and &ldquo;plok&rdquo; for &ldquo;rattlesnake&rdquo; &mdash; learning any <span class="sidenote">

</span>
 would be impossible in our lifetime, as we&rsquo;d spend an eternity just acquiring the vocabulary. Recommender systems face precisely this challenge: a popular social media platform, for instance, may have billions of items, with new ones constantly being added, making the vocabulary enormous, ever-changing, and non-stationary. Moreover, item IDs are arbitrary and atomic, with no relationship between one another that learners can exploit to speed up learning. By contrast, without knowing German, we might guess that &ldquo;klapperschlange&rdquo; (rattlesnake) relates to &ldquo;schlange&rdquo; (snake). The compositionality of language, i.e., smaller units are combined into complex phrases and concepts, allows humans to express infinite ideas using a finite vocabulary acquired in finite time &mdash; a luxury that recommender systems don&rsquo;t have.</li>

<p>In the 1960s, American linguist Charles Hockett proposed 16 <a href="https://abacus.bates.edu/acad/depts/biobook/Hockett.htm">&ldquo;design features&rdquo;</a> to distinguish human language from animal communication. The <span style="background-color: #FFC31B">highlighted</span> ones below (with my paraphrasing) are what I found most interesting and relevant to recommender systems:</p>
<ol>
<li>Vocal-auditory channel: Communication must occur through some medium that transmits a message from the communicator to the receiver. (Note: Hockett&rsquo;s emphasis on vocal communication is now outdated, overlooking sign languages.)</li>
<li>Broadcast transmission and directional reception: Message is transmitted in all directions, yet the receiver can tell from where the message came. (Without knowing who&rsquo;s communicating with us from where, we can&rsquo;t communicate back.)</li>
<li>Rapid fading: Linguistic message does not persist over time, unlike permanent forms such as stone carvings or knot-tying.</li>
<li>Interchangeability: Anyone can say anything (e.g., I can claim &ldquo;I am your king&rdquo; even if I&rsquo;m not) &mdash; unlike only queen ants can produce certain chemicals. Communicators and receivers can switch roles.</li>
<li>Total feedback: The communicator can receive their own message, allowing them to control what message to send.</li>
<li>Specialization: Communication is for exchanging messages rather than practical purposes (e.g., dogs panting to cool down).</li>
<li><span style="background-color: #FFC31B">Semanticity</span>: Symbols carry stable meanings. (The same symbol shouldn&rsquo;t change meanings from one message to the next.)</li>
<li><span style="background-color: #FFC31B">Arbitrariness</span>: Which symbols map to which meanings is arbitrary.</li>
<li><span style="background-color: #FFC31B">Discreteness</span>: Smaller symbols can be combined into complex symbols in rule-governed ways (noun + &ldquo;s&rdquo; $\rightarrow$ plural).</li>
<li><span style="background-color: #FFC31B">Duality of patterning</span>: Atomic symbols have no meaning of their own, yet they can be combined into meaningful message.</li>
<li>Displacement: Language can discuss subjects not immediately present (e.g., dinner plans for tomorrow).</li>
<li>Prevarication: We can say things that are false or hypothetical.</li>
<li><span style="background-color: #FFC31B">Productivity</span>: We can say things that no one in history has said before, yet those new utterances can be readily understood.</li>
<li>Traditional transmission: Language is socially learned, not innate.</li>
<li><span style="background-color: #FFC31B">Learnability</span>: Language can be learned (with ease in childhood).</li>
<li>Reflexiveness: Language can describe itself (e.g., &ldquo;grammar,&rdquo; &ldquo;sentence,&rdquo; &ldquo;word,&rdquo; &ldquo;token,&rdquo; &ldquo;noun&rdquo;).</li>
</ol>
<p>For recommender systems to have &ldquo;intelligence,&rdquo; item IDs need not have inherent meanings from the get-go (&ldquo;arbitrariness&rdquo;), but should be decomposable into smaller units in a hierarchical, rule-governed manner (&ldquo;discreteness,&rdquo; &ldquo;duality of patterning&rdquo;), with stable mappings from tokens to meanings (&ldquo;semanticity&rdquo;). Hopefully as a result, the system will be able to learn the &ldquo;item language&rdquo; (&ldquo;learnability&rdquo;) and generalize knowledge to new items (&ldquo;productivity&rdquo;). Spoiler alert: This is the exact idea behind Semantic IDs (<a href="https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2023/hash/20dcab0f14046a5c6b02b61da9f13229-Abstract-Conference.html">Rajput et al., 2023</a>).</p>

 in linguistics. Three years ago when I started my career as a Machine Learning Engineer, I had zero interest in language models, dead set on becoming a recommender system expert — despite closely following OpenAI since 2016 while at Berkeley. It's funny how recognizing the parallels between language and recommender systems finally helped me see the magic (structure $\rightarrow$ learnability) in the former and the beauty (can it be potentially intelligent?) in the latter.
