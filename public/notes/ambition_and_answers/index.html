<p>Friends sometimes ask about my ambitions, like why I seem to be constantly searching for new knowledge or career advancements. And I wonder about that myself: does working on a more popular product, building more powerful or interesting models, or making xx% more money at a higher level make me happier? I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>I was watching <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d95J8yzvjbQ"><em>The Thinking Game</em></a>, which reminded me of my childhood dream &mdash; like many former and current Cognitive Scientists, I, too, wondered about the essence of intelligence and how to build one from scratch. That question mattered so much to me as a kid because my childhood revolved around solving problems in order to get myself out of trouble or keep myself entertained. Years ago, I decided not to pursue that question as a researcher. Still, would knowing the answers make me happier? I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>In <em>Stranger Things</em> Season 5, Robin told Will that she used to obsess over a girl in her class, thinking getting her attention would give her life meaning. When the girl liked some boy (Steve &ldquo;The Hair&rdquo; Harrington) instead, she ceased to believe she could be herself and still be loved. After falling into a period of depression, she found an 8-millimeter film reel she made as a kid and remembered her love for filmmaking and for herself. That&rsquo;s when she realized the answer to life doesn&rsquo;t come from someone else &mdash; the answers have always resided in ourselves.</p>
<p>I was very touched, but didn&rsquo;t fully grasp how finding ambitions leads to finding answers to life. For starters, one can have many ambitions. Which is the life-defining one? Then, ambitions change. I used to obsess over detective novels and metal music as a kid &mdash; my own version of Robin&rsquo;s 8-millimeter films. But would being a detective or metal musician today make me happy? Perhaps not. So I don&rsquo;t know how an ambition anchors someone to who they are through the years.</p>
<p>But I do resonate with Robin&rsquo;s past feelings that someone else&rsquo;s attention made her feel seen, as if everything random and mundane in life suddenly had meaning and made sense. I have felt that way. But after a while, you stop being curious for the sake of curiosity and start to optimize your curiosities for external affirmation. It&rsquo;s like a model that stops learning world knowledge and becomes addicted to optimizing a benchmark. The fear of loss dominates growth.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not so sure if anyone or anything would suddenly give you an answer that grounds your life. Maybe the answer lies in none of the things above &mdash; ambitions, curiosities, or attention &mdash; or maybe all of them combined. Maybe growing up means accepting that sadness and boredom are the norm and completely fine, and that it&rsquo;s those little sparks that we live for &mdash; like an enjoyable conversation with a good friend, a nice finding at work, a tasty dish, or a beautiful scenery that lights up life for a moment, a minute, or a day. There&rsquo;s no such thing as moving forward or backward in life, since it&rsquo;s not a race. The meaning of life might just be staying alive while keeping our eyes peeled and minds open to those random, unpredictable sparks as they arrive.</p>
