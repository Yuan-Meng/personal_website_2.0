      <description>&lt;!-- # Dhanasar&#39;s Prong 1: National Importance&#xA;&#xA;The life of an immigrant hangs not by a thread, but by a sequence of precisely timed visas and forms: F-1 and I-20 when we accept our PhD offers; OPT/STEM OPT and I-766 when we graduate; H-1B and I-797 when we win the &#34;H-1B lottery&#34;; then I-140, I-485, and eventually the green card. I&#39;ve long given up trying to explain this process to American friends. Even recruiters who make a living by working with candidates of all immigration statuses are often confused by it.&#xA;&#xA;As a result of tech layoffs, labor market testing needed for [PERM](https://forumtogether.org/article/explainer-perm-labor-certification-process/) certifications is getting increasingly harder to pass. For many of us, the only alternative is to show the national importance of our work and obtain a National Interest Waiver ([NIW](https://www.uscis.gov/newsroom/alerts/uscis-updates-guidance-on-eb-2-national-interest-waiver-petitions)). Dr. Dhanasar and his team fought hard in 2016 to set the current standard ([*Matter of Dhanasar*](https://www.justice.gov/eoir/page/file/920996/dl)).&#xA;&#xA;For many of us, &#34;national importance&#34; is not an afterthought we&#39;re scrambling together for the sake of NIW, but why we decided to pursue a PhD in the first place --- we believed our work mattered to humanity, not just one nation. I did when I dreamt of becoming a cognitive scientist, believing my field held the key to what makes us human and how intelligence comes to be. I chose a tech career because it better suited my personality and goals --- it doesn&#39;t make my past research any less important. Moreover, I see the NIW petition as a fun challenge to think of future research I can realistically pursue to advance CogSci + AI --- now that I&#39;m a bit older, hopefully wiser, and know a lot more about AI/ML than when I was a CogSci PhD student. --&gt;&#xA;&lt;!-- I can&#39;t do anything unless I believe in its meaning. For instance, I can&#39;t prepare for interviews unless I believe it makes me a better engineer. Similarly, I can&#39;t prepare for an NIW case unless I believe what I&#39;ve done or am about to do has national importance. So I often go a long way in search of that meaning, including spending an insane number of hours reading and thinking about ML engineering for interviews, and in this case, cognitively inspired AI for NIW --- even though there are many shortcuts to take (e.g., memorizing answers to common interview questions, or sketching out a seemingly reasonable research agenda that has little chance of becoming real). This need to believe makes me who I am and is the motivation behind this blogpost. --&gt;&#xA;&lt;!-- There are many great NIW examples in the natural sciences --- check out chemist Andrey Solovyev&#39;s informative [I-140 website](https://andreychemist.github.io/)! As far as I know, this post may be the first related to CogSci NIW petitions. This is a WIP --- I&#39;ll update it as I think of more ways CogSci informs AGI. --&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-cogsci-has-to-say-about-ai&#34; class=&#34;scroll-mt-8 group&#34;&gt;&#xA;  What CogSci Has to Say About AI&#xA;  &#xA;    &lt;a href=&#34;#what-cogsci-has-to-say-about-ai&#34;&#xA;        class=&#34;no-underline hidden opacity-50 hover:opacity-100 !text-inherit group-hover:inline-block&#34;&#xA;        aria-hidden=&#34;true&#34; title=&#34;Link to this heading&#34; tabindex=&#34;-1&#34;&gt;&#xA;        &lt;svg&#xA;  xmlns=&#34;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&#34;&#xA;  width=&#34;16&#34;&#xA;  height=&#34;16&#34;&#xA;  fill=&#34;none&#34;&#xA;  stroke=&#34;currentColor&#34;&#xA;  stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34;&#xA;  stroke-linejoin=&#34;round&#34;&#xA;  stroke-width=&#34;2&#34;&#xA;  class=&#34;lucide lucide-link w-4 h-4 block&#34;&#xA;  viewBox=&#34;0 0 24 24&#34;&#xA;&gt;&#xA;  &lt;path d=&#34;M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71&#34; /&gt;&#xA;  &lt;path d=&#34;M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71&#34; /&gt;&#xA;&lt;/svg&gt;&#xA;&#xA;    &lt;/a&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;An important feature of a learning machine is that its teacher will often be very largely ignorant of quite what is going on inside, although he may still be able to some extent to predict his pupil&amp;rsquo;s behavior.&amp;rdquo; &amp;mdash; Alan Turing, &lt;a href=&#34;https://courses.cs.umbc.edu/471/papers/turing.pdf&#34;&gt;Computing Machinery and Intelligence&lt;/a&gt; (1950)&lt;/p&gt;</description>
